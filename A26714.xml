            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THis was the laſt Work of this bleſſed Author, and I wiſh the improvement of <hi>the ſcope</hi> of it, may be the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> work of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader. That his Works have done good, very few have ſo many Heart-epiſtles of Commendation. O let nothing be wanting on your part, but that this may do more good. Were all our Swords of Contention beaten into Plough-ſhares and Pruning-hooks, for plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the fallow ground of the <hi>Heart,</hi> for pulling up the weeds, and cutting off the luxuriances of the <hi>Heart;</hi> were this the only Contention, who ſhould moſt promote gracious heart-work both in themſelves and others: this work would afford comfort both <hi>living</hi> and <hi>dying.</hi> We are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one readier to find fault with others than to mend our ſelves; but were heart-work more minded, we ſhould have no time to ſpare for ſuch excurſions. This <hi>Treatiſe</hi> will inſtruct you in <hi>downright Chriſtianity,</hi> which, would all thoſe <hi>heartily</hi> mind that wear the name of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> we need not fear what Men or Devils could do againſt us. Let me aſſure you, it is more than a probable opinion, that unleſs we heartily mind plain practical godlineſs, it is <hi>preſumption,</hi> not <hi>faith,</hi> to expect Deliverance. God holds us hovering upon our good behaviour; our moſt
<pb facs="tcp:48705:3"/>
infallible Prognoſticks, what God will do with us, are within us. It is not what we ſeem, but what we are; God looks at the heart: When the bent and frame of the heart is right, this cannot but influence the life; and when heart and life pleaſe God, nothing can come amiſs to us; Gods ſevereſt ſtrokes will be <hi>bleſſings</hi> to us, but where the heart is neglected thoſe Providences that are moſt grateful to fleſh and bloud will be <hi>curſes</hi> to us. Chriſtians, you know it is granted on all hands, that God looks moſt at the <hi>heart;</hi> therefore brutiſh Sinners, when they would evade conviction, boaſt of their <hi>hearts</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their ignorance and ſottiſh profaneneſs, they will tell you their <hi>hearts</hi> are good; and thus the Father of Lies flatters them, and ruines them, with a good conceit of their <hi>hearts.</hi> On the other hand, the moſt ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are always complaining of their <hi>hearts,</hi> that they are dead, fickle, falſe, unſpiritual; and thus the Father of Lies diſcomforts them, by ſouring their very graces, their mortification, humility, holy jealouſie, their hatred of ſin, and ſenſe of its encroachments, are warped by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to their diſcouragement. But now a clear and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical underſtanding of the way of Grace, the way of Temptation, and the way of Duty about the Heart, will ſteer us right through all the difficulties and dangers we ſhall meet with on this ſide Glory. That this Book may be bleſſed to this end, is the hearty deſire of a willing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt and Chriſtians,</p>

Here take notice, 1 <hi>Every man hath other Keepers beſides himſelf. God is</hi> his keeper. Pſalm. 121.5. <hi>The Lord is thy keeper.</hi> Our Governors and our Teachers are our Keepers, every man is, or ſhould be his brothers keeper. Magiſtrates are the Keepers of their Countries. Miniſters are the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of their Flocks and Congregations. Parents are the Keepers of their Children and Families. We ſhould have but ill looking to, had we no other Keepers than our ſelves; and all our other Keepers, Magiſtrates, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Parents could do little towards the keeping of us, if the Lord alſo were not our keeper, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord keep the City, the watchman watcheth but in vain.</hi> Magiſtrates will but govern us in vain, Miniſters will but guide us in vain, Parents will but rule us in vain, unleſs the Keeper of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be our keeper. Oh bleſs the Lord, who though he hath put the care of us upon our ſelves, yet hath not caſt off the care of us himſelf. Let us bleſs the Lord for his care and cuſtody, and let us both take care of our ſelves, and alſo commit the care of our ſelves to him. To both we are exhorted in one word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Commit the keeping of your ſelves to him, in a way of well-doing.</hi> Take all the care you can of your ſelves, and your own ways, and then caſt your ſelves upon Gods care. <hi>Commit the keeping of your ſelves to him, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a faithful Creator.</hi> Let us commit the keeping of our ſelves to the Lord, and let us comfort our ſelves in this, that the Lord will take us into his cuſtody, there we are in ſure hands. He is faithful, and will keep what is thus committed to him. Beware you abuſe not this comfort. Dare not ſay thus, God will look to me, and therefore I need not look to my ſelf He that will not keep himſelf, God will be no keeper of him. He that will not take care of his own ſoul, ſays in vain, I have committed that care to the Lord. If thou wilt not take care of thine own ſoul, thou leaveſt it to the cuſtody of the Devil; and if thou doſt, God will leave thee to him alſo. To ſay I commit the keeping of my ſelf to God, and will not take care of my ſelf, is the ſame in effect, as to ſay, I com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Devil is a Keeper, yet not a Protector, but a Goaler, the Keeper of the Priſon. All the Sinners of the Earth are Priſoners to this Goaler: and there is no man that eſcapes this Keeper, till he will faithfully keep and look to himſelf, and ſo commit himſelf to the Keeper of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            <p>From V. 24. <hi>Put away from thee a froward mouth, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48705:6"/>
perverſe lips put far from thee.</hi> Note two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The unruly evil muſt be ruled. The Tongue is an unruly evil, <hi>James</hi> 3.8. It is one of the hardeſt works that ſome Chriſtians have to rule their Tongues: but yet it muſt be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is ſaid it cannot be done, <hi>the tongue can no man tame.</hi> What, doth Religion put us upon impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to tame that member which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>annot be tamed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The meaning there is, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> man can tame ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tongue. Thou maiſt rule thine own tongue, but if thou wilt not do it thy ſelf, it is more than all the World can do to tame it for thee. Who can ſtop uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed lips, who can ſilence the tongue of the froward? Neither Laws nor Penalties will do it, neither ſofteſt nor hardeſt anſwers will do it; when the tongue is ſet on fire, there is no water will quench it, and yet it muſt be done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which cannot be ruled, muſt be put away. <hi>Put away your froward mouth, put away perverſe lips.</hi> Put away frowardneſs and perverſneſs from thee; froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be ruled, perverſneſs cannot be kept in order. When we have done all we can, frowardneſs will be froward, perverſneſs will be perverſe; and therefore that is the way to rule the tongue, to put away that fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs which will not be ruled.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What frowardneſs is. I need not ſay much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that; moſt men know it too well in their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of the froward ones they dwell, or have to deal withal. There are few men but know what froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, unleſs it be thoſe that are froward; the eye that ſees others, yet cannot ſee it ſelf. He that is of a froward mouth is hardly brought to underſtand that he is fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. He that hath a froward wife, ſhe that hath a froward husband, they that have a froward neighbour, need not be told what frowardneſs is: but he that hath a froward heart, it is he that hath moſt need to be told it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is froward that is hard to be pleaſed, apt to be provoked, that is ever finding fault, who is like Tinder, apt to catch on fire by every ſpark, and that fire is quickly kindled, but hardly quenched; no arguments, no patience, no forbearance will do; but there it burns and will not be quenched, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Anger reſts in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48705:7"/>
boſome of Fools:</hi> of theſe froward Fools we are ſpeaking of. Frowardneſs is folly. That fire which is intended as a revenge upon others, doth burn, and vex, and fret out their own hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. He is of froward mouth, that gives vent by his lips to the frowardneſs of his heart, in virulent and bitter and provoking language.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The neceſſity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> putting it away. 1. The Lord commands us to put away froward mouths. What if thy Friend or thy Neighbour cannot pacifie or ſilence thee, ſhall not God pacifie thee neither? If thou wilt not hear Man pleading for peace and quiet, wilt thou not hear the Lord God neither? God commands thee ſilence, God commands thee to hold thy peace, and to utter not a word more of thy furious folly: what a perverſe ſpirit art thou of, on whom the authority of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not prevail. What doſt thou ſay in effect, but I will ſpeak my mind whether God like it or not? 2. It is a ſign whileſt it prevails, that mens Religion is in vain, <hi>James</hi> 1.26. <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans Religion is in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſome profeſſors of Religion, whoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is but an outſide and pretence; they do but <hi>ſeem to be religious,</hi> they <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo to themſelves, and <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo to others, but they are deceived, there is no ſuch thing as Religion in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some ſeem to be religious but <hi>bridle not their tongues,</hi> they pretend to be of circumciſed hearts, but are of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed lips.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The unbridleneſs of their tongues, is an evidence that their Religion is in vain. When is Religion in vain? Why, when it cannot reach its end, when it cannot ſave the ſoul; and ſure that Religion which cannot bridle the tongue cannot ſave the ſoul. Man, in what a caſe art thou? Thou profeſſeſt Religion, and hopeſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but if thou art of an unbridled froward tongue, thy Religion is vain, and cannot ſave thee.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Frowardneſs hinders all that little Religion that ſuch men have in the exerciſe of it; it puts them beſides Prayer, or Reading, or Meditation, or ſpending one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thought upon Eternity, all Religion is thruſt behind the doors when the froward fit is up.</p>

Where this evil reigns and is not checked nor controlled by thee, is not mourned over, nor art thou aſhamed of it, nor wilt reſiſt it; when this evil reigns, it is a ſign thou art but an hypocrite, and thy religion is in vain.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, our Lord Jeſus, whoſe Diſciples we profeſs our ſelves to be, and to learn of him, was <hi>meek and lowly, in heart, Mat.</hi> 11.29. and art thou his Diſciple, who art of a proud and furious ſpirit? The Apoſtle tells us, that a meek and quiet ſpirit is an ornament to the Goſpel, and of great price in the ſight of God, 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 3.4. If meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be an ornament, then frowardneſs is a blot and a blemiſh, and a ſtain upon our Profeſſion. If meekneſs be pretious, then frowardneſs is odious in the ſight of God. Wouldſt thou make thy ſelf a diſgrace to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, an <hi>odium</hi> and an abomination unto the Lord? If thou wouldſt not, then ceaſe from thy frowardneſs, and ſtudy, and follow after that gentleneſs, that ſweetneſs, and candor, and meekneſs of heart and behaviour, which is ſo grateful both with God and men.</p>
            <p>Friends, though I would not ſay much, yet finding it lie in my way, I would not paſs by this evil without ſaying ſomething, though but thus briefly to it. But though I have ſaid but little, yet pray let not this little be forgotten, eſpecially by any ſuch among you, whoſe Conſciences may tell you, God hath ſent this Word as an <hi>Item</hi> to me.</p>
            <p>Doctr. from V. 26. <hi>Every foot hath his path.</hi> There are two paths, in one of which every one is walking. There is the good path, or way; and there is the evil path. Theſe two are diſtinguiſhed by their ends or term to which they lead; that is, the good path that leads to Good, called <hi>the path of life, Pſalm</hi> 16.11. that is the evil path that leads to Evil, <hi>the way of death and deſtruction, Mat.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48705:8"/>2. By their Adjuncts or Qualities. The good way is general, the way of Holineſs; in particular, the way of Humility, Meekneſs, Temperance, Patience, &amp;c. the way of Faith, and Love, and Prayer. The evil way is the way of Sin in general; and in particular, it is either the way of Lying, or the way of Covetouſneſs, or the way of Pride, or Envy, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But here note <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at the good way is made up of all theſe good Qualities, or elſe it cannot be the good way; but any one of the evil Qualities makes the way evil.</p>
            <p>He that is humble and is not temperate, he that is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and is not patient, he that is patient and is not merciful, he whoſe life is not led in univerſal holineſs, that hath any one grace wanting, is not in the good way, one Fly ſpoils the whole Box. Chriſtians muſt <hi>ſtand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in all the wills of God, Col.</hi> 4.12. But for the evil way, he that walks in any one particular branch of that, his way is evil. He that is not a Liar, if he be a Swearer; he that is not a Swearer, if he be a Drunkard; he that is not a Drunkard, if he be Covetous; he that is none of all theſe, if he be carnal, and walks after the fleſh, or any one particular Luſt thereof, he is in the evil way; the path of ſin, if it be but any one ſin, that is our path, or our way wherein we uſe and allow our ſelves to walk; the path of ſin is the way of death.</p>
            <p>Now every one in the World hath his path, is either in the good way, the way of Holineſs; or the evil way, the way of Sin. And of thoſe that are in the way of Sin, ſome are in the way of the Proud, others in the way of the Scornful, others in the way of Lying, others in the way of Covetouſneſs, every one hath his way.</p>
            <p>Doctr. 2. <hi>Every path muſt be pondered.</hi> To ponder our ways, is to weigh and conſider them; the ſame which is charged, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Conſider your ways,</hi> ſpend ſome deep and ſerious thoughts upon them. Now there is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A conſideration of the ways that we have hitherto gone on in. A bethinking our ſelves, a reviewing our courſe; this is that which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought on my ways</hi> that I had hitherto been walking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I thought and repented of what I had done, I thought and turned. And this is that for which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48705:8"/>
               <hi>No man ſaid, what have I done?</hi> No man ſaid in his heart, no man thought with himſelf, what have I done?</p>
            <p>For the Objects of theſe thoughts muſt be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The matters that we have done, the particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our lives. Carnal men never obſerve, or mark what they do; they never review or reflect upon their actions. How many words do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en ſpeak, how many works are men engaged in, that they never obſerve, or mark, or beſtow one thought upon, they cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ways, becauſe they do not obſerve their ways. Think what you have been doing all your life long; think what you have neglected to do, and think what you have done, and are doing to this day; let your eye be upon the particular actions of your lives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Quality of our ways, whether they are good or evil, whether they are holy or ſinful. Thy way hath been the way of Lying, the way of Covetouſneſs, the way of Pride, a carnal, careleſs, fleſhly way; think with thy ſelf, Is this a good way, or an evil way, do theſe my ways pleaſe God, or are they contrary to God?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The end of our ways, or whither they tend, and to what iſſue they will come at laſt. Is this my way to God? Is this the way of the everlaſting Kingdom? Is this the path of life? Have I been all this while in the ſtrait and narrow way that leads to life, or have I not hitherto been travelling in the broad way that leads to deſtruction? This worldly way, this fleſhly way, it is that which hath pleaſed me at preſent; but whether will it bring me at laſt?</p>
            <p>Sinners, bethink your ſelves thus, Whither is it that I am going? What is like to be the end of this courſe I am taking? Either to God or the Devil, either to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Hell, every one of you have been going, and which of the two have you been making towards? Is lying the way to God? Is Drunkenneſs and carnal mirth and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is this the way to Heaven? Is hardneſs of heart in your way? Is impenitence in your ſin, is this the way to bleſſedneſs? Do not your own hearts tell you, I muſt turn out of theſe evil paths, I muſt take a new courſe ere ever I can be ſaved?</p>
            <p>Be ſo wiſe as to ſpend ſome ſuch thoughts. This is ſinners great folly and their great miſery, that they run
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48705:9"/>
on in their ways and we cannot perſwade them to think whither they are going. But what is it of ſo little weight with you whether you are ſaved or damned, that it is not worth a few ſerious thoughts. Sure you could never go on at that ſenſleſs rate you do, if you did think whither you were going. We come and preach Chriſt and righteouſneſs and holineſs to you, as the only way of life; you have been often told that Chriſt is <hi>the way, and that no man cometh to the Father but by him, Jo.</hi> 14.6. And you have been told that there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God by Chriſt, to Heaven by Chriſt, unleſs there be a coming to Chriſt, a joyning your ſelves to him as his diſciples and followers. <hi>Him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out. Jo.</hi> 6.37. but will bring him to Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have been often told that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. That this way of Faith in Chriſt and this way of holineſs is the only way of life, this hath been told you, this hath been preached to you over and over again and yet we cannot perſwade you into this way. The reaſon is becauſe you will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we preach, you will not conſider what it is to be damned and periſh for ever; you will not conſider whether you can think of any other way by which it is poſſible to eſcape damnation but this way of faith and holineſs. If you did conſider and underſtand what an Hell it is whither your neglect of Chriſt and running on in your ways is leading you, how hot that furnace is into which you are like to fall within a few days, how dreadful it will be when you are in once, and ſhall feel the ſcorching of thoſe flames. What think you, would not ſuch ſcalding and burning thoughts make you weary of your ſins, and willing of Chriſt. Would they not awaken you, would they not affright you out of this ſecure and vain courſe that you are now going on in.</p>
            <p>Where do you think your fellow-Swearers, and fellow-Drunkards and fellow-Worldlings that have been cut off in their ſins and carried away into the other world in there impenitence, that were laughing with you, and mocking and ſcoffing with you a few years ago; where do you think they are now? What do ye think they are doing at this hour? O, it would make an heart of ſtone to tremble and quake to think what their companions that are dead in their ſins do now ſee and feel. Think

It would make thine eyes ſtare, and thine hair ſtand on end, and thy bones ſhiver to think where they are. <hi>O conſider this ye that forget God leſt he tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver you</hi> from that place of the dead, that place of Pitch and burning Brimſtone, where you have reaſon to fear your companions in ſin are frying at this hour. Whilſt Chriſt is preaching to you, whilſt God is yet a warning you to fly from the wrath to come! Oh how are they tearing their hair, and biting their tongue and wringing their hands to conſider, that preaching of Chriſt to them ſhall be no more, that all their warnings are over, that they muſt for ever feel and faint, and periſh under that wrath which is now too late for them to fly from, or eſcape. Beſtow ſome thoughts upon your companions that are dead and gone, and then conſider your ſelf, whether if you keep on the ways you are walking in, you muſt not ſhortly be with them, in the ſame condemnation, and if yet you will not conſider it preſently as <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.20 <hi>in your latter end you ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it perfectly.</hi> Therefore yet again I ſay to you, and charge you from the Lord, conſider your <hi>preſent</hi> evil ways and to what a fearful end they will certainly bring you, if you ſpeedily turn not out of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſidering the ways that are before us, that we ſhould for the future go on in. God hath given ſinners there choice whether to continue as they are in the ſame way, or to take up a new and a better way of life. Think what you have done and how you have lived, and think what you have now to do for the future, <hi>let thine eyes look ſtraight on, &amp;c.</hi> What courſe do you think it is beſt for you to take for the future? Doſt thou think it is beſt to continue as at preſent, to hold on your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in your drunkeneſs, in your lying, in your carnal careleſs courſe; or is it not beſt for you to hearken to Chriſt, and to turn from your ſins, and to betake your ſelf to a ſerious, godly and holy life? Which of the two is beſt? May be, it never came into your thoughts to put the queſtion to your ſelf, but you have run on from one day to another, without asking, What were I beſt to do? Why, now here is that I would perſwade you to; to look
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48705:10"/>
before you, and conſider, What is beſt for you from henceforth to reſolve upon; What would a wiſe man do in this caſe; what choice would a wiſe man make? Sure methinks, a little conſideration ſhould bring you to this, If I be wiſe I ſhould turn and knock off from my wonted ways, I ſhall be a fool and a mad man if I go on thus. What doth God offer to pardon my neglects of Chriſt, my neglects of my ſoul, and all my ſins, if I will yet but turn to him? What, doth Chriſt yet offer to bring me to God, and to ſave me from the Eternal Dungeon, if I will yet come unto him, and become a new creature? What will my going on as I have hitherto done, my ſpending the remainder of my life, as I have ſpent that which is paſt in ſin and vanity, will this a running on upon mine own death, and a ſhutting up the door of mercy forever againſt me, and yet ſhall I continue as I am? Is there a way of life yet before me, is there a door of mercy, yet open to me, and ſhall I not get into the Way and be making towards the door? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinners what is the beſt, the wiſeſt and the only ſafe courſe to take from henceforth, and do accordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Why muſt we ponder our paths?</p>
            <p n="1">1. God pondereth them. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 26.7. <hi>Thou weigheſt the path of the juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The devil pondereth them, <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.31. <hi>That he may ſift you as wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Wicked men our enemies ponder them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our way may be right in our own eyes for want of conſideration, when yet upon conſideration it may appear to be the way of death. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.12. <hi>There is a way that ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a way of ſome men that is not ſo much as right in their own eyes, who, as little as they do conſider it, do ſee their way to be the way of death, and not of life; the way of the openly Prophane, the way of the Drunkard, and Adulterer, the way of the Swearer, and Blaſphemer. Prophanneſs doth not pretend to be the way of life, Drunkards and Adulterers know they are out of the way, their conſciences tell them this is not the way of God, this is not the way to heaven; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells them I muſt turn I muſt repent, and take up a better way ere I die, I muſt not die a Drunkard I muſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48705:10"/>
not die a Blaſphemer, or a Scoffer, I muſt repent or I am loſt; and hopes they have that they ſhall repent, and this their hope hardens them, The conſideration that ſuch men ſhould take up, is not to convince them that they are out of this way of life, that they know already; but to convince them of the neceſſity of a preſent turning and changing their way. Dareſt thou not to die a Drunkard, or a Libertine, or a Licentious Liver, how then dareſt thou to live ſo a day longer? Art thou ſure but that death may meet thee before thy turning day comes? And how if it ſhould? thou knoweſt that then there is no hope of thee, but Everlaſting wrath muſt be thy portion. Thou counteſt upon turning and repenting, but conſider what is the reaſon thou doſt not repent at preſent, that thou doſt not this day give a divorce to all thy wickedneſs, ſhake hands with all thy companions, and forthwith become a new man. Why not now? O I cannot bring mine heart to it. And doſt thou in good earneſt think that it will be eaſier hereafter? Hath the Lord been perſwading thee to a change all thy life long, and thou ſeeſt his word cannot prevail, thou ſeeſt it doth not after all thy convictions, and fears, and threatnings of the Word and checks of thy conſcience, hitherto thou goeſt on, thy luſt is too hard for thy conſcience, or convictions, and doſt thou think in thy heart that this is the way to make it eaſy to repent, to continue longer in thy ſin? A courſe of ſin hardens thee, ſinner. Thine heart is not ſo hardned againſt repentance this year, but look for it, thou art like to find it harder the next year. The farther thou goeſt on in ſin the farther off art thou from repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are others whoſe ways are right in their own eyes, which conſideration would make appear to be the way of death and not of Life. I ſhall inſtance in two ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ways of moral unbelievers. Theſe are they that are ſober and temperate, and harmleſs, and juſt in their dealings with men, and courteous and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, this is their way and this way ſeems right unto them, in this way they hope to come to heaven, though whatſoever they have of morality they have nothing of Chriſtianity in them. Converſion or Regeneration are as ſtrange things to them as they were to <hi>Nicodemus. Jo.</hi> 3.3. who when Chriſt told him, <hi>except a man be born again he cannot ſee the kingdom of God,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>how
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48705:11"/>
can theſe things be?</hi> And they have need to ask as Pilate did, what is truth? So they, what is this new birth? what is this new creature? what is this converſion? Conſider man, what doſt thou think of this plea at laſt when this is all thou canſt ſay, I am an honeſt man, but God help me, no good Chriſtian, I am no drunkard, but yet an unbeliever: I am no Lyar nor Swearer, but yet no convert to Chriſt. Conſider thoſe ſcriptures. Jo. 3.3. <hi>except a man be born again he cannot ſee the kingdom of God:</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d Mat. 18.3. <hi>Except a man be converted he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> And doſt thou bleſs thy ſelf in thy harmleſs and leſs vitious way, when thou haſt never felt any ſuch thing as Regeneration upon thee? This thy way is thy folly, and though it be right in thine own eyes yet it is, and thou will find it to be the way of death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The way of hypocritical profeſſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites know themſelves hypocrites, and the way ſeems not right to them; others are hypocrites, and yet take themſelves to be ſincere and the deceit of their hearts may be ſo deep that there is need of deep conſideration to diſcover it. They pray and they hear, and have ſome face of Religion upon their ways; they will ſpeak of God, and the things of God with ſome affection and live in the viſible communion of the church with good appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, they are it may be, well reputed and well report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among all men, and yet for all that, the root of the matter may not be in them, they may be unſound and rotten at heart, and neither themſelves know it, and others ſuſpect it, there may be ſome ſecret reigning luſt in their hearts, they may be lovers of the world, <hi>lovers of their eaſe or their pleaſures more than lovers of God,</hi> Whatever they have, there may be <hi>one thing lacking,</hi> as it was the caſe of the young man, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21. whoſe life was commendable in many things, yet ſays Chriſt, <hi>one thing lackeſt thou,</hi> and that one lack was loſs of heaven. And have we not all need to conſider our ſelves, and to conſider deeply how it is with us. A ſincere Chriſtian is an entire chriſtian. <hi>pſal.</hi> 119.1. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled</hi> that is the entire in their way; that labour to be entire lacking nothing; and ſure we had need conſider whether we are or no.</p>

            <p>What is the Soul? Moſt men know not what, and none of us know perfectly what a Soul is. It is our inward and inviſible ſubſtance which gives life to our bodies; it is an eſſential and the moſt excellent part of us, That hath moſt of the nature and image of God in it. It is our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal part, that hath life in it, and gives life to the body, and never dies. Our Reaſons and Wills, whereby we differ from Brutes, theſe are the eſſential faculties of our ſouls. The Soul is that, in which our capacity lies, of the higheſt bleſſedneſs, and the extremity of miſery. The bleſſedneſs of the Soul is the higheſt bleſſedneſs. The Body as ſuch, is capable of no greater happineſs than a Beaſt is capable of; onely the pleaſures of ſenſe: the Soul is capable of ſpiritual and eternal pleaſures; the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Soul are moſt exquiſite and intolerable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the burning of the Body is nothing in compariſon of the wrath of God burning in the Soul.</p>
            <p>The excellency of the Soul above the body, you may gueſs at, by conſidering what the Body is when the Soul is departed. What a gaſtly thing, what a ſtinking and rotten Carkaſs doth the moſt beautiful Body become when it is dead, and the Soul is departed. It was this, the Soul of Man that was the great prize that Chriſt had in his eye, when he died to redeem us, he died to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem ſouls, eſpecially to recover that bleſſed immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that our Souls had loſt; the natural immortality they had not loſt. That is a great part of our miſery, that ſin left us immortal Creatures, ſuch, of whoſe miſery there ſhall never be an end. It was not our natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, that Chriſt died to recover, that was not loſt, but our bleſſed immortality. This inviſible, immortal, moſt excellent part of Man, his Soul; this is it which we are to underſtand by Heart. <hi>Keep thy heart,</hi> that is, <hi>keep thy ſoul.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The ſouls of all men naturally are loſt ſouls. It may be ſaid of every ſinner, as the father of the prodigal ſaid of him, <hi>Luke.</hi> 15.32. <hi>This my ſon was loſt,</hi> Fathers, you may ſay of every child you have, whilſt they are in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate, this my ſon is loſt, this my child is a loſt child, yea and you may ſay the ſame of your ſelves, whileſt in your ſins, mine own ſoul is a loſt ſoul; and whether you will ſay it or no, we muſt ſay to every one of you, fathers and children, that are yet in your ſins, you are loſt ſouls. As Chriſt came himſelf, ſo he hath ſent us in his name, to ſeek and to ſave them that are loſt. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.10. What is it to be loſt? Why, it is the ſame as to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to be damned perſons, ſignifies to be loſt, and to be loſt, in this ſpiritual ſenſe is to be damned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that word, 2.

                  </gap>ſt,</hi> to them that be damned, that is, in a ſtate of damnation, and in the way to actual and everlaſting damnation. O tremble ſinners, tremble all you that are yet in your ſins; what will you tremble at, if not at being damned; the word calls every man of you, that are not in Chriſt, Reprobates from God. 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Know ye not that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi> Is Chriſt in thee? Art thou a convert to Chriſt? No? Then thou art a reprobate from God, thou art a damned, loſt ſoul; live and die in this eſtate thou art in at preſent, and thou art eternally loſt. What mean you ſinners, that you are ſo much at eaſe ſo much at reſt in your ſtate of ſin? Is it nothing to be damned? Is it nothing to be Reprobates? O think what it will be, to be found Reprobates at Judgment, and then to have the ſentence of reprobation pronounced upon you why ſure ſinners, the very next miſery to that, is to be in a ſtate of reprobation. O take this home to you, as your portion from the Lord, every unconverted one, take this word home to you; take it into your own mouths,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48705:14"/>
O what ſhall I do! I am a loſt child, I am a loſt ſoul; wo is me I am undone, a ſon of perdition and an heir of damnation. What is it to me, that I have kept my body in good caſe, that I am in health? What is it to me, that I have kept my eſtate, and have not been ſuch a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of that? that I have my houſe, and my lands, and my money, what is it that I have kept my credit, and my friends? O my ſoul, my poor ſoul is loſt, and what good ſhall my eſtate, or my health, or my credit, or my friends, or my life do to me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Mens ſouls are not ſo loſt here, but that they are recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> In a little time, if they look not to it, they will be paſt recovery for ever. Yet a little while and the Goſpel will be a ſealed Book to you, never again to be opened, yet a little while, and the door of mercy and grace will be ſhut againſt you, never again to be unlocked. When death hath once ſealed up ſinners eyes, when the grave hath ſhut her mouth upon them, then every one of you that is found in his ſins, the Goſpel is ſealed up, the door of mercy is ſhut up, and thou wilt be loſt forever, irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loſt. But yet ſinners, theſe loſt ſouls may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. There is great hazard at preſent, that thou mayeſt not be recovered, but <hi>yet</hi> there is hope.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ther's great hazard at preſent that thou mayeſt not be recovered.</hi> Do not make light of the hazard that is, do not make ſure, ſay not ſuch a word, I doubt not but by the grace of God I ſhall have mercy, and be ſaved, Ther's great hazard that that ſoul of thine which is a loſt ſoul this day, may be loſt for ever, and never be converted and ſaved.</p>
            <p>How great that hazard is, I have formerly told you out of the Pulpit, and now you may read the ſame things from the Preſs, namely in my diſcourſe on Prov. 28.14. read that book carefully once eſpecially from p, 171. to page, 198, where you may underſtand how great hazard there is, that loſt ſouls may not be recovered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Yet there is hope thou mayſt be recovered.</hi> For;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Your ſouls are yet every one of them, within the reach of the bloud of Chriſt.</hi> You are come to <hi>that bloud of ſprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.24. <hi>Which ſpeaks better things then the blood of Abel.</hi> There is not one Sinner among you, but at preſent the bloud of Chriſt ſpeaks for you; and what doth it ſpeak? Father, if this Sinner turn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48705:15"/>
let him not be rejected; let him be pardoned and be ſaved. For Believers, it ſpeaks thus, Father theſe my Friends have believed, and have repented, and therefore I pray thee, let them not fail of having the benefit of my bloud, let them not fail of their pardon and ſalvation. Thus for Saints, and even for every unconverted Sinner it ſpeaks conditionally, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> if they will believe, if they will yet turn, let them alſo have the benefit of my bloud. Hitherto every one of you are thus far within the reach of the bloud of Chriſt; it pleads thus with the Father for you, and if you will come in, will make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for, and redeem and recover you from all your ſins.</p>
            <p>When once Death hath cloſed your eyes, in your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted eſtate, you are gone for ever out of the reach of the bloud of Chriſt, it can now no longer profit you, nor plead for you. There is nor one drop of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious bloud ſhall ever fall into the Pit, nothing of the bloud of Chriſt ſhall come into Hell, and find you out there, but only the guilt of his bloud, that ſhall fall upon Sinners in Hell, the guilt of deſpiſing his bloud, the guilt of trampling on his bloud. This is all that ſhall be ſaid to ſinners there, in the Pit, theſe are they that would none of me: I would have waſhed them with my bloud, but they would not be waſhed; I would have ſaved them by my bloud, but they would not be ſaved: I called upon them to turn from their ſins, and come unto me, but they would not turn, they would not come: I offered to purge them from their ſins, to pardon and make, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for their iniquities, but they would not be pardoned nor purged; they loved their ſins, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened their hearts, and threw back my bloud in my face, they would none of me; and now let the guilt of my bloud, be upon them, to heighten their flames, and burn in their bowels for ever.</p>
            <p>The guilt of his bloud ſhall reach to Hell, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation and attonement of his bloud ſhall never come there. After Death, there is nothing but Hell, and out of Hell there is no recovery, thoſe Sons of Perdition are loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>O thank God, Sinner, that thou art not yet fallen in thither; thank God that that ſoul of thine is not in Hell. How many younger ſinners than thou are there already,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48705:15"/>
roaring under the ſenſe of their madneſs, in neglecting Chriſt and his Redemption. O thank God, that thou art here, thank God that thou art yet alive, that Chriſt yet calls to thee to come to him, that Chriſt yet offers thee, that if thou wilt but turn and repent, his <hi>bloud ſhall cleanſe thee</hi> from all <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and ſave thee from coming into condemnation.</p>
            <p>Sinner, there is yet hope of thee, that thou mayeſt be ſaved, though there be hazard, great hazard, that thou wilt yet harden thy heart to thy deſtruction, that thou wilt never be converted and be ſaved; there is great hazard that though thou be yet out of Hell, thou wilt be there ſhortly, though thou art yet within the reach of the bloud of Chriſt, thou wilt in a little time be without its reach; but though there be ſuch great hazard that thou mayeſt die for ever, and be irrecoverably loſt, yet there is at preſent hope concerning thee, that thou mayeſt be recovered; and there is this hope concerning thee, that thou art yet within the reach of the bloud of Chriſt. O thank God for it, and do not go on to harden thy heart, till thou art paſt recovery. I ſay again, thank God that thou art here, but yet I muſt add, thank God and repent, thank God and be converted, or elſe it were even as good that thou wert in Hell this hour, as to be here in thy ſins: nay, it were better for thee that that body of thine were now rotting in the Grave, and that ſoul of thine were now roaring in Hell, this would be better for thee than to be here hearing the Goſpel, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all thou ſhouldſt live and die unconverted, and ſo go to Hell at laſt. Theſe very warnings that now thou haſt, if they ſhould not work upon thee to turn thee from thy ſins, and bring thee to Chriſt; if the Goſpel ſhould leave thee in the caſe thou art this day, thou wilt to Hell as ſure as if thou wert there already; and then all that thou now heareſt, or ſhalt ever hear whilſt thou liveſt will but heat thy Furnace ſeven times the hotter againſt thou comeſt down. But becauſe there is yet hope, thou mayeſt be converted, thank God thou art here, for there is hope as from this firſt ground, becauſe thou art within the reach of the bloud of Chriſt; ſo</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is hope from this, that ſinners are yet under the miniſtry of reconciliation:</hi> as the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>To us is committed the word of reconciliation,</hi> So we may ſay
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48705:16"/>
to ſinners, to you it is given to hear the word of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; it is for your ſakes that this word of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is committed to us, that we might preach it unto you. God hath not onely continued you within the reach of the bloud of Chriſt, but under the teachings of his Miniſters, whoſe work it is to tell you how you may have the benefit of his bloud, to make a tender and offer of this bloud of Chriſt to you, and to perſuade and make you willing to accept it; we are ſent to preach Chriſt unto you, and to make known unto you what help there is in Chriſt for you, and what freedom you have given you to lay hold on Chriſt; and alſo to perſuade and bring you into Chriſt, that you may have the benefits of his bloud. It is a ſtrange word we have given us, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28. <hi>Compel them to come in.</hi> Go and call poor ſinners to me, and if they be not willing to come, compel them in; not force them in whether they will or no: Chriſt will not have any ſinner againſt his will, but compel them, that is, uſe all the importunity you can, to make their unwilling ſouls willing; uſe ſuch arguments, as if it be poſſible, they may not be able to reſiſt; and though they do reſiſt, yet do not give them over ſo, but do your your beſt by your importunity to overcome their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>Go, ſays Chriſt to his ſervants, fetch in all the ſinners in the Country to me, here is room for them all, as many as there are come already, yet there is room for more, <hi>v.</hi> 22. Let my <hi>houſe be filled with gueſts,</hi> filled with Converts; go find out theſe poor wretches where they lie rotting and periſhing in their ſins, and bring them in. Chriſt doth not ſay to his Miniſters concerning ſinners, as once he did to his Diſciples concerning little children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.14. <hi>[Suffer] little children to come to me,</hi> ſuffer poor ſinners to come to me, do not put them back, or diſcourage them when they would come, but perſuade them in, help them in, preſs them to come in, beſeech them to come and be reconciled to God, I am not willing that any of them ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould be brought to repentance, and obtain everlaſting life, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. This is the buſineſs of our Miniſtry, and this Miniſtry of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, thou poor ſinner art under to this day.</p>
            <p>Now does not all this give ſinners hope that yet they may be recovered? Why, hath God let thee live to hear
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48705:16"/>
this word? Why hath God brought thee hither this day to hear it? What, canſt thou not ſay, I hope it is that I may be converted, I hope it is that I may be recovered? The Lord yet comes among you to tell you what you muſt do to be ſaved, what you muſt do to get Chriſt to be yours, to preach repentance to you, that you may <hi>recover your ſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are held captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.</p>
            <p>Sinners, You are all Priſoners and Captives, but yet you are Priſoners of hope? you are dead ſouls, but there is hope you may be made alive; you are loſt ſouls, but there is hopes you may be found. There is hazard that you may be quickly irrecoverably loſt, but ſome hopes there is you may be recovered.</p>
            <p>O will you come to Chriſt, will you come to the means grace, <hi>as men of hope!</hi> Hear the Word, in hope that it may work ſavingly upon you; pray for ſuch a work, in hope that God may hear, though all the ſinners among you, in one ſenſe are men of hope, yet in another ſenſe the moſt of ſinners are men of no hope; in this ſenſe you are all men of hope, that there is a door of hope yet open to you; but in this ſenſe you are men of no hope, that is, if you continue as you are, there is no hope but you muſt periſh. A wild and groundleſs hope too many ſinners have; they hope againſt hope, they hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery without uſing the means of recovery, they hope for ſalvation without reconciliation, they hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion without repentance, they hope to be redeemed from death without being redeemed from iniquity; this is to hope againſt hope, this is to hope for that of which there is no hope. There is no hope of ſalvation without repentance, no hope of eſcaping without returning. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel are to break down ſuch falſe and deceitful hopes, not to build them up.</p>
            <p>That which, from what hath been ſaid, I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you to, is to hope for ſalvation, and in that hope to look after converſion; to hope for converſion, and in that hope to hear the converting word; to hope for a new heart and life, and in that hope to pray that God will give you this new heart. Dare not to ſleep in hope, to ſin in hope, to harden your ſelves in your ſins, in hopes of forgiveneſs; pray in hope, hear in hope, humble your ſelves in hope, turn in hope, that God will accept and be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48705:17"/>
merciful to you. When you come to hear, do not come as moſt ſinners do, not knowing or conſidering wherefore they come together: but when thou goeſt to hear and to pray, go with this hope in thine heart, I am going to hear the word of Faith, the word of Repentance, and I hope God will bleſs it to me, that it may work Faith and Repentance in me. I am going to hear the heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the heart-humbling word, the converting word, and I hope the Lord will humble, and break, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert me by it. I have often heard, and have been never the better; hitherto I have not been humbled, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by it: this wretched heart is as dead and as hard as if it had never been preached to. Well but doth the Lord yet again call me forth to hear this word? O I will go in hope, that yet at laſt it may work upon me.</p>
            <p>Hope hath two things in it, Deſire and Expectation. This is the hope I would perſuade you to come to the word in, to come with deſire to be wrought upon, and expecting and looking for ſuch a gracious work. We may ſay concerning this firſt coming of Chriſt into the heart, as is ſaid concerning his coming to Judgment. Heb. 9.28. <hi>To them that look for him ſhall he appear without ſin unto ſalvation.</hi> So to thoſe that look for him, ſhall he appear to their ſanctification. Look to meet with Chriſt this day in his word, look for Chriſts coming down to meet with you this day, deſire that he would, pray that he would, and expect and look for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, and appearing to you. This is the hope, wherein I would exhort you to attend on the means of grace, with deſires and expectations of the gracious ſucceſs of them upon you. And if you would thus come to hear in hope it would much encourage us, to preach in hope to you, and to pray in hope for you.</p>
            <p>Well to conclude this, let every ſinner of you know that whilſt the word of reconciliation is continued to be preached to you, ſo long there is hope concerning you, that you may be recovered. There is hazard, great hazard, a great doubt whether you may be ſaved, a great fear that many of you may never be converted and ſaved, but though there be hazard yet there is hope.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The great care that lies upon every ſinner in the world, ſhould be that he get to be rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

2 Tim. 2.25.26. <hi>Inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them repentance that they may recover themſelves, out of the ſnare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve. 1. <hi>That loſt ſinners are in the hands of the Devil,</hi> taken captive by the Devil, held in the ſnares of the Devil. That is a loſt ſouldier, that is fallen into the hands of his enemys; That is a loſt ſheep that is fallen into the paw of the Wolf; That is a loſt ſoul that is fallen into the ſnares of the Devil, and in thoſe hands are every loſt ſoul. How art thou ſo ſecure ſinner, how ſo merry, how ſo much at eaſe? Doſt thou know where thou art? Thou art in the hands of the Devil, that ſoul of thine is taken captive by the Devil, and lies bound in his ſnares; the Devil hath taken thee, and the Devil hath bound thee that thou canſt not get looſe. O it were well if ſinners underſtood their caſe and in whoſe hands they lye. There is never a one of all the ſinners among you, but the Devil hath him in cuſtody. Whither ever thou goeſt, the Devil goes with thee, to watch thee that thou mayſt not eſcape him. If thou goeſt to read, the Devil goes with thee to thy Bible, to hinder it from working upon thee, if thou goeſt to pray, the Devil goes with thee to hinder thy praying; and now thou comeſt hither to hear, the Devil comes to Church with thee, to harden thine heart againſt the Word.</p>
            <p>Thou doſt not ſee the Devil here, and thou doſt not think he is here, but thou mayeſt know by the effect, that he hath been here with thee, every day and at every Sermon, thou mayſt know it by this, that the Devil hath been here with thee, that the Word hath proſpered no more with thee, to the reſcuing thee from his ſnares, and he that hath been here is now come again, and he is now watching thee that thou hearken not to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That loſt ſinners oppoſe themſelves againſt their own recovery. [Inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves]</hi> that is, that reſiſt the word of grace, that Deafen their ears and harden their hearts againſt it. Acts 7.51. <hi>Ye have always reſiſted the holy ghoſt.</hi> The word of God comes, and the ſpirit of God comes to convert ſinners, but they reſiſt their own mercy. The enmity that is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48705:18"/>
in their hearts, oppoſes it ſelf againſt the Word and ſpirit. Mat. 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered you, but you would not!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The end of preaching the goſpel to ſinners, is to recover their loſt ſouls; Inſtructing them &amp;c. that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnares of the Devil. To open the blind eyes, to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Sathan unto God,</hi> Acts. 26.18. We are ſent as Chriſt was, to preach deliverance to the captives, and the opening the priſon to them that are bound; and not only ſo, to preach upon the priſon doors, but to perſwade the priſoners to come out of priſon. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 46.9. <hi>That thou mayſt ſay to the priſoners, come forth.</hi> God hath ſent us with this word to you, that are impriſoned under Sathan, come forth poor priſoners, come forth out of priſon. Sinners give no better entertainment to us, than if our word to them were, come into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, come into bondage; they take that word, come into Chriſt, as if it were the ſame, with come into into priſon, come into bondage; that chriſtianity which we perſwade ſinners to, they look upon it as meer bondage: but what ever ſinners think, our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to perſwade them out of their houſe of bondage. Come ſhake off your chains, knock off your fetters, break that yoke of the Devil which is upon your necks, get you looſe from thoſe ſins and thoſe luſts, wherewith the Devil hath held you, and come unto Chriſt; it is no bondage to be a Chriſtian, Chriſts ſervants are all free-men; you are all bond-men already, <hi>in the bond of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity. Acts.</hi> 8.23. But who among you would be ſet at liberty? What do you mean ſinners, will ye die Bondmen? We may ſay concerning you as Chriſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 31.16. <hi>Whom Sathan hath bound theſe</hi> 18 <hi>years.</hi> You are the men whom Sathan hath bound; not only theſe 18 years but ſome of you theſe 38 years, nay ſome it may be thoſe 60 years or more. Have you been bound ſo long bound by the Devil, and are you not willing to be looſed? will you go priſoners to the Grave? From this upper priſon, ſhall the Devil carry you down into the eternal priſon? O ſinners, that is our buſineſs from God to you to perſwade you to make an eſcape, and to be recovered, out of the ſnares of the Devil.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Sinners recovery begins in their repentance. If God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48705:18"/>
give them repentance that they may recover.</hi> They are only the penitent, that are recovered ſouls, As long as thou art an impenitent ſinner thou, art a loſt ſoul. <hi>Acts.</hi> 28.27. <hi>Leſt they ſhould be converted and be healed; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner, is an healed, a recovered ſinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is God that recovers loſt ſouls. If peradventure God may give them repentance that they may be recovered.</hi> It is the Devil that takes ſinners captives, but it is God that reſcues the prey from his teeth. It is the Devil that leads men to ſin and holds them under ſin, but it is God that gives them repentance. Is thine heart har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dned in thy ſin? Is thy heart hardned againſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Canſt thou not turn? Canſt thou not repent? Go to God, poor ſinner, it is he that muſt give thee repentance. Go to Chriſt, it is he that God hath exalted, and ſet upon purpoſe, that he may give repentance and remiſſion of ſins. <hi>Acts.</hi> 5.31. Miniſters are to preach repentance, but they cannot give repentance we muſt every one of us ſay, it is not ours to give. We can tell you to whoſe door you muſt go for repentance, we can tell you in what way you are to go to God for it, and we would perſwade you to God, but when we have faid all we can, it is he alone that can give repentance to you and work it in you.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Whatever God does to the recovery of loſt ſouls there is ſomething lies upon themſelves to do towards it. That they may recover [themſelves]</hi> No that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but may recover themſelves. Now here I ſhall ſhew you more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What the recovery of loſt ſouls means, or wherein it ſtands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What ſinners may do towards their own recovery.</hi>

            <p>Sinners, whileſt they are beſotted with luſt and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, cannot reaſon thus, their ſenſes have drowned their underſtandings. If they had but their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and their wits about them they might reaſon thus with themſelves, what a miſerable caſe is this that I live in? this poor ſoul of mine is ready to ſtarve and die.

Is there no way for recovery out of this brutiſh ſtate? May not this mad ſoul of mine be recovered into his wits again? I have lived a mad life hitherto, elſe I ſhould never have fed upon husks, theſe pleaſures of ſin, whileſt bread, the bread of God might be had. I have not the underſtanding of a man in me, or ſure I ſhould get me out of this miſerable eſtate.</p>
            <p>Sinners, who hath bewitched you? What is it that hath ſo unmanned you, that neglecting and running away from God, you ſhould run thus after the Devil, and live among his Herd of Swine, and feed upon traſh and droſs; the beſt of your ſinful pleaſures are no other, nor better. You have your feeding among the Swine, and your lodging with them, wallowing with them in the mud and mire. You may know what your feeding is, by the ſtarveling caſe your ſouls are in; and we may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48705:19"/>
ſee what your lodging is, by the filth and dirt that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. Behold the mud and the mire cleaving to thee, thy filthy luſts and vile affections, and ſpiritual unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, wherewith thou art polluted. When wilt thou come to thy ſelf, ſinner, and bethink thy ſelf of returning from the Husks to Bread, from thy Trough to the Table, from the Stie of Swine to thy Fathers houſe? Is it not better to be a ſervant of God, than a drudge to the Devil? Is it not better to be of Gods holy ones, than of the Devils bemired and mudded ones? Is it not better to return into favour with God, rhan to live in exile and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God? Doeſt thou not think, that thoſe that love God, and fear God, and walk with God, that thoſe that know Chriſt, and are waſhed with his bloud, and walk in his ſteps, and have laid hold on his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhall be partakers of his ſalvation; Doſt not thou think in thy heart, that theſe Saints are in better caſe than thou art? Is it as well with thee now thou art ſuch an ignorant, ſenſual, ſwiniſh, carnal, ſtupid ſoul? Is it as well with thee now, as if thou wert changed into the image, and made partaker of the holineſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the ſalvation of God? Doeſt thou bleſs thy ſelf that thou art none ſuch? Is it well for thee that thou art no Believer, or ſincere Convert to God? When wilt thou come to thy ſelf? Shew your ſelves men, Sinners, let your underſtandings once return into you. You wil never come to be Chriſtians, till you come to your ſelves. Shew your ſelves men, and that you have the underſtanding of a man in you; recover your reaſons, and then make uſe of your reaſons, and fall a reaſoning with your ſelves, What ſhall I do? Shall I continue as I am? a Drunkard as I am, a Worldling as I am, a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualiſt as I am, a ſervant of my Fleſh and of the Devil, as I am, or ſhall I ariſe and go to my Father? Which do I really judge to be better for me, to go on as I have done, or to make out after a ſudden and ſaving change? To go on after my cups, and my companions, after my pleaſures, and my worldly profits, or to return to the Lord? Haſt thou recovered ſo much of thy reaſon, as to judge it to be better for thee to turn, and become a new man, haſt thou ſo? then from a man of reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man of reſolution. Judge what is beſt, and chuſe what is beſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48705:20"/>
and return to my firſt husband, for then was it better with me then now.</hi> Sinner, Wilt thou take up ſuch a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Wilt thou take up ſuch words? Well, I ſee now what I have been doing all my life hitherto, I ſee to what a ſad paſs my fooliſh and carnal ways have brought me; I ſee the poverty and the miſery, and the ſtraits, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that by running away from God, by running after this World and the luſts thereof, I have run my ſelf into. Well, I have done with this vain and fooliſh life, I will go and return unto the Lord, and then it will be better with me than now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next ſtep to this recovery is coming to God; the firſt is coming to your ſelves, and the uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of your reaſon and underſtanding. And who among poor ſinners ſhall theſe words preach into your right ſenſes? You have been fooliſh, ſenſleſs ſouls, is there any of you that are yet come to your ſelves? Do you judge it better for you to come back from your vain ways, and to come about to the Lord? Is this voice heard in your hearts, Oh, if I could break off from my ſins, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a real Convert to Chriſt, then would it be better with me than now. It would be an happy change, this day would be an happy day, this Sermon would be to me an happy Sermon, if the Lord would bleſs it ſo to me, as to bring me off from my ſins and bring me to God, O how wonderfully better would it be for me than it is now.</p>
            <p>If any of you are come ſo far to your ſelves as to judge and to ſay, it would be better for me, let me go on with you and ask you further; What will you reſolve upon? Will you ſay on with the Prodigal, well, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father.</hi> It is better for me ſo to do, and I will do it, through the help of God I will return. Now for Repentance, now for Religion and Righteouſneſs, now for a new heart, and a new life, I have done with my old heart, Sathan I have done with my old life, ſin and vanity I have done with, henceforth through the grace of God, I will be for God and godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Do you ſay ſo? Are you reſolved ſo? Come on but one ſtep further; if you ſay the word, come on, and do likewiſe; the Prodigal when he ſaid, I will go to my Father, he aroſe and went accordingly. Be not like the Son in the Parable, who ſaid, <hi>I go Sir,</hi> but went not; but

ſay, and do, come and joyn your ſelves to the Lord, come into his houſe, come into his ways, give your ſelves to him for his ſervants, and go on and ſerve him, then were your ſouls recovered. Then ſhould it be ſaid to you, as concerning him, <hi>Theſe my children were dead and are alive, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O let the Lord God thus rejoice over you; O let all his Saints rejoice with you: Come ſinner, make a joyful day of it, come unto the Lord, come to your Father, and he will be ready to meet you, and with open heart and open arms would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What men may do to recover.</hi> They cannot recover themſelves of themſelves, it is God that muſt do it, but they may and muſt do ſomething towards it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Men can pray for their recovery.</hi> Even carnal men may pray, and though there be no full promiſe that God will hear, yet God hath both required them to pray, and hath appointed this as a means of their recovery. <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.22. The Apoſtle bids <hi>Simon Magus</hi> pray that <hi>the thoughts of his heart might be forgiven him.</hi> It is an hopeful ſign that God has a purpoſe to give grace, when he ſets ſinners a praying for grace; at leaſt, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray themſelves they can ſpeak to others that can, and deſire them to pray for them. This that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did, he begged the Apoſtles to pray for him, O what a wretched caſe are thoſe in, that will neither pray for themſelves, nor ſo much as beg Chriſtians to pray for them! Sinner, when didſt thou ever do ſuch a thing? When didſt thou ever go, either to a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or a Chriſtian with ſuch a word in thy mouth, <hi>pray for me.</hi> It may be when thou haſt been ſick, thou haſt ſent to the Congregation to pray for thy bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but when didſt thou ſend or ſpeak to them to pray for thy ſouls recovery? Is not thy ſoul more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than thy body? Is it not thy ſoul more deſperately ſick, than ever thy body hath been? is not prayer for ſick ſouls as needful, and as much prevailing, as prayer for ſick bodies? And yet how many bills have we ſent in, to pray for recovery from bodily diſeaſes, to one
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48705:21"/>
ſent in, to pray for the converſion of a ſoul? But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou do it or not, this thou canſt not deny, but thou canſt do this towards thy converſion, thou canſt pray for it, and deſire others to pray for thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Men can hear the Word.</hi> This is another means of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Men can give heed to what they hear.</hi> They can mark and obſerve what the Word ſpeaks, <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Take heed how ye hear;</hi> Give heed to what you hear, and do not ſleep under the ſound of the Word, or fit heedleſly or careleſly, without minding what the Lord ſpeaks. And herein is the great neglect; Sinners will come to a Sermon, but mind as little what is preached to them as thoſe that never come here This is a wretched neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and the common caſe of many hearers. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Hearing they hear and do not underſtand.</hi> Our words could not have ſuch poor ſucceſs if people would mind more the things that we ſpeak. O ſinners bethink your ſelves, how often have you been here, and not heeded one word that hath been ſpoken?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Men can think.</hi> What is eaſier than thoughts; we uſe to ſay good words are cheap, but good thoughts are cheaper than good words: the exerciſing of mens thoughts is noted to be the firſt ſtep to repentance. 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 8.47. <hi>If they ſhall bethink themſelves,</hi> and repent, and ſo, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought on my ways and turned &amp;c.</hi> Thou ſayſt thou canſt not <hi>recover</hi> thy ſelf.

Thou heareſt ſometimes from the Miniſtry of the Word, that thou art a loſt man, a loſt ſoul; But when thou heareſt it preacht to thee, canſt thou not think upon it? Thou doſt not think upon it, it is too true, no longer than the Word is a ſpeaking, nay it may be nor then neither. What thoughts have you had of it, ſince you were told that naturally you are loſt, and what a miſerable caſe it is to be a loſt ſoul. Have you ſince thought ſuch a though, Wo is me I am a loſt ſoul, oh what a poor

Thou [doſt] not think of theſe things, it is true, but [canſt] thou not think of them? Thou knoweſt thou canſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Men can ſtop, and make a ſtand in their evill ways, from going on further in them,</hi> from making their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition worſe than it is and their recovery more difficult. Canſt thou not lay thine Hand upon thy mouth, when thou art about to lie, or to ſwear or to ſcoff, and bite in thoſe evil words, that are coming out? Canſt thou not keep thee from thy Companions, and thine old drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and riot? Canſt thou not keep thee out of the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe or the Tavern? Thou canſt do it, ſuch outward acts are in the power of the will to reſtrain. Men may be true if they will, and ſober if they will; If thou wilt be a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard or a Swearer, or a Lyar, who can help thee? But if thou wilt thou mayſt help it thy ſelf. It is true thy caſe is miſerable enough and thy cure hard enough, by thy continuing in thine evil way hitherto; but as bad as it is with thee, it is growing worſe and worſe; every ſin thou goeſt on to commit, is a new gaſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou giveſt a deeper and more deadly wound to thy poor periſhing ſoul.

Thou canſt pray, thou canſt hear, thou canſt give heed to what thou heareſt, thou canſt think, and thou canſt ſtop and make a ſtand in thy evil ways. And if thou wilt but do what thou canſt, thou mayſt have hope that God will do that for thee which thou canſt not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>How we may know whether we are recovered or no.</hi> This I ſhall ſhew, 1. <hi>Negatively.</hi>

Though the light hath ſhined into thy darkneſs, yet thy darkneſs comprehendeth it not. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.5. Poor ignorant ones, in what a caſe are you? you are every one of you loſt ſouls.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe whoſe conſciences are loſt.</hi> Who though they may be recovered to be men of underſtanding, yet are not recovered to be men of conſcience. <hi>We truſt we have a good conſcienc willing to live honeſtly in all things.

Heb.</hi> 13.18. Thus it is with recovered ſouls, they are men of a good conſcience. Where conſcience is laid waſte, the ſoul ſtill lyes open to the government and dominion of the Devil. Conſcience is a bar and a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark againſt his aſſaults and temptations. Where conſcience is not, the ſoul is as a City that hath neither Gates nor Bars, but is left open to the Devil, to rule it at his pleaſure. God hath not recovered the rule of any ſoul, till Conſcience be awakened and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered its authority.</p>
            <p>Art thou an unconſcionable man or woman? Doſt thou make no conſcience of thy ways? Haſt thou ſlighted conſcience, haſt thou wounded conſcience ſo long, that now it lets thee alone to thy will and thy luſt? Or if it checks thee ſometimes, for thy evils, yet thou beareſt it down, and goeſt on thy way againſt its reproofs and contradictions? Art thou a man of no conſcience? Is it not againſt thy conſcience to lie, or to defraud, or to drink to drunkenneſs, to live without praying or minding God or thy ſoul? Does conſcience let thee alone to live thus? Or if it doth ſmite thee, yet goeſt thou ſtill on againſt it? Art thou a man of no more conſcience than this, what doſt thou think of thy ſelf? What ever thou thinkeſt thou art a loſt ſoul, while conſcience is loſt, thy ſoul is loſt. Till conſcience be recovered thy ſoul is not recovered and conſcience is never recovered, till it hath recovered its authority, and hath gotten the rule and the Government of thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thoſe who make light of their diſeaſe and their miſery.</hi> Men are never recoverd till they are firſt made ſenſible of their diſeaſe. Sin is thy diſeaſe, and thy death, and thou art never recovered from that death, till thou art brought to a ſenſe of thy diſeaſe. Where there is life there will be ſenſe. They were dead ſouls, alienated from the life of God who were paſt feeling, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.19. Thoſe that make light of ſin, it is a ſign they are not recovered. Sin is felt as an heavy thing, by thoſe ſouls that have the life of Chriſt begotten in them.</p>
            <p>O what multitudes of loſt ſouls are there among us, if every ſoul be loſt that makes light of ſin! What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count doſt thou make of it? Thou ſinneſt dayly, thou liveſt an idle and a careleſs and a ſinful life, thou art

proud or covetous, or a ſenſual fleſh-pleaſer, and is not all this this ſin? Thou art a Liar, a Promiſe-breaker, a defrauder, and is not this thy ſin? Thou art perverſe and peeviſh and of a froward heart, and is not this thy wickedneſs? But what account doſt thou make of all this? Is it an heavy thing to thee, to be thus ſinful? No, not at all, thou makeſt light of thy pride, and light of thy covetouſneſs, and light of thy frowardneſs, thou makeſt juſt nothing of them, or at leaſt but ſmall matters. Thou doſt not feel them to be ſuch a weight and burthen to thee, but thou canſt bear them and go out with them well enough. Or if thou doſt ſometimes feel ſome ſmart or pain by them, yet it is but ſuch a light touch, that what ever thou thinkeſt at preſent thou wilt quickly after them again, at thy lying again, at thy ſwearing again, at thy froppiſh and froward carriages again.</p>
            <p>It is ſuch a deep ſenſe of ſin, as will make us beware of it for the future, that wil prove our recovery. What ſhall we then think of them that make a mock of ſin, that make a ſport of ſin, that take pleaſure in iniquity?

Shall I come into that miſerable ſoul of thine, and dwell there, and rule there, and caſt that Devil out that hath been thy deſtroyer and murderer?

With all my ſoul, Lord, come in thou bleſſed Lord, all that is within me ſhall rejoyce that thou wilt thus enter upon me, and take me for thy poſſeſſion and habitation. This one would think ſhould be the anſwer that ſinners would give. But behold, ſuch miſerably fooliſh ſouls are ſinners become, that they make light of all this. A cup of drink, a carnal companion, a luſt, a ſenſual pleaſure, is made more reckoning of than Chriſt and all his love. As it is ſaid of thoſe Builders, the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11. It is true of all ſinners, this ſtone, this pretious ſtone, this corner ſtone, this foundation ſtone, upon which alone their hopes of ſalvation might be built, this ſtone is ſet at nought by them, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53.3. <hi>He was deſpiſed and rejected of men,</hi> they made no account or reckoning of him, but even tread under foot the Son of God. And this is the general entertainment that Chriſt hath among the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth, ſo light do they make of him; he comes to them, but they will not receive him. How often, ſays he, would I have gathered you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. but you would not.</p>
            <p>And what is the common caſe of ſinners, is it not [thy] caſe? Art not thou one that makeſt light of Chriſt? He hath been preached unto thee, he hath come and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf to thy ſoul. That vile heart of thine, ſinner, that dark hole, where the Devil and Luſt, and every abomination dwells, Chriſt hath come and called to thee, open to me, let me come and dwell there, and caſt the Devil out. How many knocks hath he given at thy door? How many Meſſengers hath he ſent to thee with this word, Open thoſe wretched hearts, open the everlaſting doors, and the King of Glory ſhall come in? And haſt not thou ſlighted all this, and put a contempt and a ſcorn upon an offered Jeſus? Who, I? God forbid; I adore and honour that worthy name, I acknowledge him to be the Son of the living God, and the Saviour of the World, and worthy of all acceptation. I, but haſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48705:24"/>
thou accepted? Haſt thou opened unto him? Haſt thou received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord? Is Chriſt within thee? Is the light of Chriſt, the love of Chriſt, the holineſs of Chriſt in thee? Haſt thou reſigned up the throne and dominion of thy ſoul to him, and given him hearty leave to put all that is within thee in ſubjection to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to caſt out what ever is an offence to him? to caſt the World out, to cut the fleſh down, and the luſts thereof? Hath he new made thee, and new molded thee.</p>
            <p>Is there another Spirit begotten in thee? a new heart beſtowed upon thee? Hath he made a Chriſtian of thee, a ſincere inward Chriſtian, not in word, nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth? Art thou become his hearty Diſciple, and his follower in holineſs? Hath he given thee the underſtanding of a Chriſtian? Doſt thou know God, and art thou now acquainted with the myſtery of the kingdom of God? Doſt thou know Chriſt, and the myſtery of Chriſt crucified? Hath he given thee the heart and affections of a Chriſtian? Hath the World loſt thine heart, have thy companions loſt thee, thy carnal pleaſures loſt thine heart? Is thine heart ſet upon Chriſt, and upon all his holy ways? Art thou now brought about from ſinful pleaſing of men, or affecting to live in their good repute and good will, to be all for pleaſing God? Is thy ſoul that was bent upon earth and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities thereof, now bent for God, and for heaven, and for holineſs the way to the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p>Sinner, If thou haſt received Chriſt into thy ſoul, there are all theſe works begun, there is ſuch a change as this wrought upon thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. He that is in Chriſt is a new Creature, and if there be no ſuch change, if thine old ignorance, thine old worldlineſs, thine old delights in the luſts, or friendſhip or fellowſhip of the World remain, if thou haſt not the inwards of a Chriſtian, an holy heart, an heavenly mind; yea, and ſomething of the outwards of a Chriſtian, an holy converſation, an heavenly life: If there be not ſuch a change wrought in thee, but thou art of the ſame life and the ſame ſpirit thou wert of, thou haſt not received Chriſt: he hath been offered thee, but thou wouldſt none of him; he hath come unto thee, but thou haſt refuſed him. And what ever honour thou haſt in thy mouth for Chriſt, if
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48705:25"/>
thou haſt refuſed to receive him, thou art one of thoſe that haſt made light of Chriſt, yea and ſet him at nought. That which is rendred refuſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22. <hi>The ſtone which was refuſed by the builders,</hi> is expreſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4 11. to be ſetting at nought. <hi>This is the ſtone which was ſet at nought.</hi> Sinners, every one of you that have not received Chriſt into your hearts, you have ſet Chriſt at nought, you have deſpiſed and trampled him under your foot; and if you go away from his word to day, as you have uſed to do other days, and return home without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of him, you go on to ſet Chriſt at nought. You that hear Chriſt preached, and will not receive him, if you ſhould be asked when you come home, what you have done at Church to day? You muſt anſwer, I have put a ſlight, and contempt upon Chriſt; he was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to me, and I was told of his wonderful excellencies, and his worthineſs, but I have deſpiſed and neglected it all; I have been at Church, but to mock Chriſt, and to ſet him at nought. This do every one of you, to whom Chriſt is preached, and yet you will not receive him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe that make light of Chriſt are not recovered by him.</hi> This is ſo evident from what hath been ſaid, that I ſhall add no more concerning it but this, if Chriſt be the only recoverer of loſt ſouls, then thoſe that refuſe him are not recovered. He is our Redeemer, and there is no other ſaviour. He is our Phyſitian. and there is no other helper, <hi>neither is there ſalvation in any other. Act:</hi> 4.12. If there be no other Saviour but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, if there be none recovered by Chriſt, but thoſe that prize and put ſuch an high value on Chriſt, as to embrace and accept of him, then thoſe that make light of Chriſt and refuſe him are loſt ſouls to this day. Theſe are the negative marks which evidence ſouls ſtill loſt. If you are not groſly ignorant, but have underſtood ſomthing of the doctrin of Chriſt, If you have ſomthing of conſcience, If ſome prizing of Chriſt, yet you may not be recovered; but if not, thou art a groſly ignorant ſoul, and of no conſcience, to be ſure thou art a loſt ſoul to this day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Affirmatively:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The man whoſe eyes are opened:</hi> that is, who hath recovered his underſtanding, and the ſaving knowledge of God. The firſt ſtep towards the converſion of a ſinner,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48705:25"/>
is the recovery of his ſight, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>To open blind eyes &amp;c.</hi> And it is not every little opening the eyes, and the getting in a little knowledge, that is a ſure ſign of converſion; There are knowing ſinners, knowing hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, It is an enlightning of the mind, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the mind. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Be ye transformed, by the renewing of your minds.</hi> The mind of the Convert, doth not only ſee other things, than it ſaw before, but looks upon them with another eye, as he hath another heart, ſo he hath another eye, a renewed mind, a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified underſtanding, that perceives the beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God and his ways, of Chriſt and his graces, that ſees wiſdom and goodneſs, and an excellency and deſirableneſs in them; the carnal mind, what ever it perceives of the things of God, yet they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him. 1. <hi>Cor,</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit,</hi> for they are fooliſhneſs to him, neither can he know them.</p>
            <p>Where ſee, 1. What account carnal men have of ſpiritual things, they look on them as fooliſh things, poor and weak and contemptible things, and look upon them all as a company of fools, and giddy brain-ſick folks, that will have any thing to do with them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That whilſt he looks on the things of God as fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſuch contemptible and unworthy things, he doth not know them, nor can he know them whilſt he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to be ſuch a fooliſh ſoul. Thou takeſt upon thee to cenſure thoſe that fear God as fools, and to charge Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with folly! Proud Fool! get thee a little more underſtanding, and then thou wilt ſee what an ignorant, poor miſtaken ſoul thou art. The convert looks upon the Goſpel, and the goodneſs of God, and the grace of Chriſt, and the holineſs of the Spirit, as marvellous things, excellent things; he ſees an excellency in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, a beauty and deſirableneſs in all the ways of God; he ſees the folly of Sin, and the wiſdom of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the baſeneſs and unworthineſs and the filthineſs of Sin, and the worth and the purity of Religion; he ſees himſelf to have been a very beaſt and a fool, whilſt he continued and went on in his ſins, and can never have a good thought of himſelf, but as far forth as he is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his ſins, he looks upon that little change that is begun as a bleſſed change and a comfortable change.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48705:26"/>
Now I have ſomething of the underſtanding of a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into me, Now I thank God I begin to live and ſtand up from among the dead; <hi>O</hi> I thank God for this little wiſdom that is begotten in me. I was a very fool till now, I have been told I was a fool, I have been told I was a beaſt many a time, but I could never ſee it till now, until the Lord hath thus opened mine eyes; this is ſome degree of the ſinners recovery, ſuch an opening of his eies, though it is poſſible he may be very much recovered in this reſpect and yet be a ſinner ſtill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The man whoſe heart is opened.</hi> Thus <hi>Lydia's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is expreſſed, <hi>Acts.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Whoſe heart the Lord opened.</hi> There is a double opening of the heart.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>An opening of the heart to the Lord, ſo as to receive and embrace him when offered.</hi> The hearts of natural men are ſhut againſt the Lord, they are not only void of grace, and without Chriſt, but bolted and bar'd up againſt Chriſt and his grace, they are unwilling of converſion, unwilling of ſanctification. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. <hi>O Jeruſalem wilt thou not be made clean?</hi> No, they will not. O ſinner wilt thou not have the Lord to be thy God, wilt thou not have Jeſus to be thy Lord? Wilt thou not that he ſhould come into that ſoul of thine, and waſh thee with his bloud, and govern thee by his ſpirit, make thee a new ſoul and of another ſpirit than thou haſt been? No, thou wilt not, thine heart is ſhut againſt Chriſt. To the Devil thou wilt open, to the world and its luſts and its pleaſures thou wilt open thine heart, nay, it ſtands open night and day to theſe, but it is ſhut againſt Chriſt and his grace; thou art not willing that Chriſt ſhould come in. Sinners, if your hearts would but open, Chriſt would come in this very hour and bring in his ſalvation to thee. There is not one man amongſt you all, that ſhall go home this day, without Chriſt, without the ſanctifying grace of Chriſt, that is but unfeignedly willing to give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him. Art thou willing of Chriſt, willing to have grace? Wilt thou ſo receive Chriſt as to reſign up thy ſelf to his guidance and government, art thou really willing? this is the very opening of thine heart to the Lord wherein thy converſion ſtands. Thou art the man whoſe heart the Lord hath opened.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>An opening the heart to godlineſs or chriſtianity.</hi> The former opening notes a readineſs of the heart to receive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48705:26"/>
Chriſt in, and his Grace in. This opening of the heart notes the ſouls letting it ſelf out after Chriſt and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ways, a letting its ſelf out in holy deſires. in love and holy affections, in reſolutions and holy purpoſes to ſerve and cleave to the Lord. When the heart is open to Chriſt, it is open to Chriſtianity. When it hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, it will be for walking in him. The heart of the Hypocrite, though it profeſſeth to be open to Chriſt, yet it is ſhut againſt Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Hypocrites are willing of a part in Chriſt, in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and hopes, and comforts of the Goſpel, and ſo will truſt in Chriſt, and boaſt of Chriſt, and glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in Chriſt Jeſus; but as to the exerciſe of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, eſpecially in thoſe harder and ſeverer parts of it, the mortifying the fleſh, the denying themſelves, the being crucified to the World, the cloſe, and downright and induſtrious following the Lord in holineſs; of this they are not willing, their hearts are ſhut againſt it. That heart that is ſincerely opened to the Lord, and hath indeed taken Chriſt in, doth freely open it ſelf to all the ways of the Lord, and hath a propenſion and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion, and reſolution for powerful and practical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. He is a reſolved Diſciple of Chriſt, a reſolved follower of Chriſt. Now this is the recovered ſoul, the man <hi>whoſe eyes are opened,</hi> who hath the knowledge of God, of the beauty, and excellency, and goodneſs of all the ways of God; and the man <hi>whoſe heart is opened,</hi> who hath both received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and who is reſolved to walk in him, this is the ſoul that was dead and is alive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Are ſinners loſt ſouls, then let us take up a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation over them. What a lamentation did the Prophet take up over the ſinful Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.1. <hi>O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the ſlain of the daughters of my people.</hi> O what a ſlaughter hath ſin made amongſt us, our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes our Streets, our Congregations, how full are they of the dead, dead ſouls whom ſin hath ſlain! Behold the dead that are in every place; ſo many ſinners, ſo many dead and loſt ſouls. Here be the dead, but where are the mourners? <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. <hi>Conſider ye and call for the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing women, that they may come, and ſend for cunning wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> skilful at mourning, <hi>and let them make haſt and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48705:27"/>
and our eye-lids guſh out with water.</hi> Women are more pityful than men, and more apt to mourn, Call ſays he, for the pityful among women, let them take up a wailing for us, and let them ſet us a mourning, let the women ſet the men a mourning. that [our] eyes may run down with tears: and <hi>v.</hi> 20. let the Mothers teach the daughters wailing, <hi>and every one her neighbour lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Why what is the matter? <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>O Death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces;</hi> our houſes are houſes of the dead. It is not onely with us as with <hi>Egypt,</hi> when their firſt-born were ſlain, when there was not an houſe in the Land wherein was not one dead; there are but few houſes in our Land where there is one alive; they are almoſt all dead, dead Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, dead Children, dead Husbands, dead Wives, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Death hath not onely entered in at our windows, and ſlain here and there one, but the doors have been ſet open to it, whole Families are deſtroyed. Our houſes are become Sepulchres, places of the dead.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould we mourn over loſt ſouls?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe there are ſuch multitudes of them.</hi> Come where you will, into what Country, into what Family, into what Congregation you will, and you may ſee almoſt as many dead men as you may ſee men. It is but here and there one living ſoul is to be found; ſuch a great ſlaughter as ſin hath made, calls for great lamentation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe they are in ſuch a pitiful and lamentable caſe.</hi> What is it to be a dead and loſt ſoul? where ſhall we have them a little while hence? Thoſe that are under the power of death, are under the power of the Devil, and thoſe that are under the power of the Devil, you may look to find them ſhortly in the place of the Devil. At preſent they ſeem to be in a paradiſe, they live at eaſe, and in plenty, and in peace; there are none ſeem to be ſo much alive, as the ſinners of the earth, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.15. <hi>We call the proud happy,</hi> and the prophane and fleſh-pleaſers, and the covetous, theſe are counted happy ones. They are far, they ſhine, they glitter, who but ſinners! Theſe are the only men, the only happy men, as the world counts them; but what ever there be upon their backs or in their bellies, their poor hearts are dead, and where ſhall we find theſe flouriſhing and proſpering
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48705:27"/>
ones a few days hence? It would pity ones heart to think where; What if you ſhould ſee all theſe dead buryed, buryed in Flames, caſt into the Pit of everlaſting darkneſs, and everlaſting burning? You cannot but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that there they will be ſhortly, thither they are travelling; their way is the way of death, and their ſteps lead down to hell, and how ſuddenly may they be ſwallowed up of the Pit? O pity theſe loſt ſouls! have you any bowels? Parents, have you any bowels for your ſinning children? Friends have you any bowels for your ſinning Friends? Draw forth your bowels in ſighs and lamentations, pour forth your hearts at your eyes, and fall a weeping over them, look upon the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ſottiſh ones, look upon the looſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ones, the lying children, the ſwearing and curſing and drinking and unruly children among you, and let your eye affect your heart. Yea, weep not for them only, but as. <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.28. Weep for [your ſelves] and for your children.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe they will not mourn for themſelves.</hi> They are not ſenſible of their own miſery, nor will lay it to heart. Theſe loſt ſouls are men beſides themſelves, diſtracted ones, out of their wits <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> The prodigal was out of his wits whilſt he was running his wild courſe, he was not himſelf.

Such mad ſouls are the miſerable ſouls of ſinners. <hi>Job</hi> 11.12. <hi>

Surely thoſe that are in ſuch a miſerable caſe, and have not the heart to mourn for themſelves, or to count themſelves mournful and pitiful ſpectacles, there is the more reaſon we ſhould take up a lamentation over them.</p>
            <p>Let us lament therefore, that there are ſuch multitudes of miſerable ſouls, that there are ſo few amongſt thoſe multitudes of loſt ones, that we ever ſee to be recovered.

Haſt thou not pity upon that poor ſoul of thine, but thou wilt give it up to be racked, and torn, and burned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, rather than for its ſake thou wilt deny thy will, or thy luſt, or thine appetite?

If there be a God, I will venture his wrath; if there be an Hell, I will venture on its flames,

rather than not enjoy my will, or mine eaſe, or my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Is this thy caſe?

What joy to the Mariner, who hath been toſſed with tempeſts, to have gotten ſafe to ſhore? Haſt thou ſhot the gulf, and gotten ſafe to land? Haſt thou gotten death and hell under thy feet?

Stand Chriſtian, ſtand and look back on that death that was lately feeding on thy ſoul; ſtand and look down into the hole of the pit from whence thou art delivered. Remember how it was with thee, not long ſince, when thou wert without Chriſt, and without hope, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World; when thou wert a ſlave to every luſt in thy heart, to every vile companion, when thou

wert by led by the Deſtroyer, and poſting on to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; When thou Wert without fear and without ſenſe of that danger, and miſery which was running upon thee like a floud. Remember how it was with thee when God firſt open'd thine eyes and thy fears came upon thee. How did thy ſoul cry out, I am loſt, I am undone, when thou ſaweſt what a gulf there was fixed between thy natural eſtate and the ſtate of grace? When thou ſaweſt a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of converſion, and yet wert aſtoniſhed at the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of obtaining it? When thy proud heart would not ſtoop, thine hard heart would not break, nor yield unto the Lord? When thou wert afraid that thou ſhouldſt have periſhed in the birth, and never have ſeen life; remember how it hath been with thee, and how it is now. What, hath the Lord delivered thee from thy fears, conquered to thee thy difficulties? Is thine heart broken and brought about to the Lord? Is the day broken, and the day ſtar riſen in thine heart, art thou paſſed from death to life? What ſ yſt thou now? Is it not meet thou ſhouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice? Is not this birth day, the day of thy new birth, a day of joy and praiſe? Doſt thou not bleſs thy ſelf, that it is not with thee as it hath been? Does not thine heart ſhake to think, what if I had been let alone, let to go on in the way that I was going? I went with the Drunkards, I was among the Lyars, and Swearers, and Covetous, and the Scoffers, I was one of them; As much againſt a new heart, and new life as any of them, as true a drudge to my fleſh, and this world, as the worſt of them; How is it that the Lord God ſingled my ſoul out of that wicked crowd and brought me up out of that ſtate of the dead and brought me into the light of life, and hath written me amongſt the living in <hi>Jeruſalem! Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me, bleſs his holy name. Magnifie the Lord, O my ſoul, and let my ſpirit rejoice in God my Saviour. He that is mighty hath done for me great things, and holy is his name.</hi>

This I ſhall ſum up in this one word; To perform the conditions of their recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. What are thoſe conditions?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To accept of Chriſt as your ranſom;</hi> to give off all other hopes of recovery, and to take him as our only Redeemer. Some ſinners reject Chriſt, and will none of him; they care not for a ranſom, nor will mind any ſuch thing as their recovery, but are content to be ſlaves to Sin and the Devil for ever; like thoſe ſlaves under the Law, who when they might, would not go out from their Maſters, but would have their ears bored to the threſhold, that they might not depart for ever. How many ſuch deſperate wretches are there among ſinners? Sinners they are, and ſinners they will be; ſlaves to the Devil they are, and they will not accept of deliverance. Chriſt is preached to them a Redeemer, and tendered to them as their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48705:32"/>
and liberty is offered to theſe captives, but they will not accept him: they ſay in their hearts as that ſervant, I love my old Maſter, I love my ſins, I love my luſts, thoſe very chains by which the Devil holds them, and reject Chriſt who comes to ranſom them.</p>
            <p>How is it ſinner, that thou art yet a captive to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and a ſlave to thy ſins? How is it that thou art left out from among the redeemed ones of the Lord? There is a ranſom paid, there is a price laid down, to buy out that ſoul of thine from the wrath of God; and this ranſom hath been offered thee, and thou haſt been perſuaded to come out of the priſon, but yet there thou art, yet thou art a bond-ſlave to the Devil and thy ſin. Why is it thus with thee? Why? onely becauſe thou wilt not accept of thy ranſom, thou wilt not accept of Chriſt who would redeem and recover thee. Thou art ſuch a ſtupid, ſenſleſs ſoul, that thou doſt not mind any ſuch thing as thy recovery or redemption: thou mindeſt thine eaſe or thy pleaſure, thou mindeſt thy trade and thy gains, and thy buſineſs in the World, but thou never mindeſt the redemption of thy ſoul; never haſt ſuch a thought, how ſhall I eſcape out of the hands of the Devil? How ſhall my ſoul be delivered from ſin and everlaſting wrath? When doſt thou uſe to mind ſeriouſly any ſuch thing? Not being ſenſible of thy miſery, thou mindeſt not thy recovery; and not minding thy recovery, hence it is that thou mindeſt not thy ranſom or Redeemer, but makeſt light of Chriſt and his redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and makeſt ſo light of him, that thou wilt not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and embrace him when offered to thee. Well, but whatever thou haſt done, take heed thou do ſo no more. Haſt thou yet this price in thine hand, is there yet a ranſom to be had for that miſerable ſoul of thine? Doth Chriſt yet ſtand over thee, offering thee his bloud, offering thee himſelf to be thy redemption? Take heed how thou goeſt away again, neglecting to accept and make him thine own. This is one condition upon which redemption may be yours, if you will accept of Chriſt as your ranſom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To accept of Chriſt as your Captain:</hi> To liſt your ſelf under him as his Souldier, to give up your ſelf to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and ordered and governed by him; to follow your great Leader, when he hath broken the bars, and opened the Priſon doors and knocked the Goaler in the head, and commands you out of Priſon, and calls to you
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48705:33"/>
all, Follow me. This is another condition of your reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, <hi>Follow your Captain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no man that ſhall have the benefit of Chriſts ranſom, that will voluntarily ſtay behind in priſon. Art thou reſolved to ſerve the Devil ſtill, to follow thy luſt ſtill? Doſt thou refuſe to follow Chriſt, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and governed by him? Then thou canſt have no benefit by his ranſom. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>He became the author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation to them that obey him.</hi> Well, would you be recovered by Chriſt, then liſt your ſelves under him as your Captain, be commanded and governed by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To accept of Chriſt as your Phyſician.</hi> This accepting of Chriſt as your Phyſician, notes three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A willingneſs to be healed by Chriſt.</hi> Some ſinners, though they will ſay, I accept of Chriſt for my Phyſician, yet they are not willing to be healed by him: they love their diſeaſe, and do not love their health. Sin is their diſeaſe, and holineſs is the health of their ſouls. Sin is their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and yet they love their ſin: Drunkards love to be Drunkards, the Voluptuous love their pleaſures, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous love their covetouſneſs, and the carnal their carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Swine do not more love the mud and the mire, and to be wallowing in it, than ſwiniſh ſinners do the mire of their luſts and ſins. Sometimes they pray for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, pray for repentance, pray for new heart and life, but they would be loth that God ſhould hear their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; Sin, which is their diſeaſe, is that they love; and holineſs, which is their health, they loath and hate. If Chriſt call to them, come to me, and I will make a Saint of thee, I will fetch thee off from thy drunken Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, I will cure thee of thy Covetouſneſs, I will waſh thee from thy filthy luſts, and make thee one of mine holy ones; what would they anſwer? No, I deſire no ſuch cure; I love my pleaſures, and my company, and my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and carnality; and for holineſs, let them hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thee that have a mind to it, I have no liſt to be of thoſe holy ones. When Chriſt came to cure bodily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, the blind and the lame, and the lunatick, and the poſſeſſed of Devils, how glad were they to be cured? But blind ſouls, and lame and lunatick ſouls, ſick and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed ſouls, are not willing of Chriſts cure. <hi>The carnal mind is at enmity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. Pſal. 50.17. <hi>Thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my words behind thee.</hi> Sinners
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48705:33"/>
had rather that Chriſt would let them all alone as they are; they would that he ſhould ſave them from Hell, but they would not that he ſhould turn them from their ſins.</p>
            <p>Chriſt will never ſave men from wrath, who will not be healed of their ſins; and Chriſt will not heal, till men be willing to be healed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt will never ſave men from wrath, who will not be healed of their ſins.</hi> Unleſs he waſh thee, he will not bleſs thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.8. <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi> Whileſt thou art a Sinner thou art a Swine thou art a Viper, thou art a Leper; thy very nature is ſwiniſh, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and tainted with an hereditary leproſie. Chriſt will make another manner of creature of thee than thou art, ere ever thou ſhalt ſee his ſalvation. Doſt thou think that Chriſt will drive over theſe herds of Swine, into the Land of Promiſe? Will he people Heaven, with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers? or with ſuch an unclean leprous brood, as the unconverted ſinners are? Be not deceived, nothing that is unclean ſhall enter in thither. That heart of thine muſt be changed, that corrupt nature of thine muſt be purged; of a Swine thou muſt be made a man, and the old man muſt become a new man, or thou wilt never be made a bleſſed man. If Chriſt do not heal thee he will never ſave thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt will heal none but thoſe that are willing to be healed.</hi> His firſt queſtion to thoſe he comes to cure, is the ſame as that which was put to the impotent man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> This queſtion Chriſt is daily put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to you, You that are blind, will you that I ſhould open your eyes? You that are poſſeſſed of a Devil, of an unclean Devil, of a proud Devil, of a covetous Devil, will you that I ſhould caſt this Devil out? You whom Sathan hath bound theſe many years, bound under a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, ſinful, hardned heart, will you be looſed from theſe bonds? You whom the Devil hath been leading on after your pleaſures, or your carnal liberties, by the chain of your evil natures, will you that I ſhould cut the chain, and put a ſtop to the Devil, and turn you back from your courſe, and never ſuffer you to be Drunkards any longer, or Fleſh-pleaſers any longer, or Covetous any longer? Is it thy diſeaſe, that thou haſt been ſuch a vile liver ſo long, wilt thou that I ſhould put a ſtop to thee, that thou be never ſuch any more? Chriſt doth ask ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48705:34"/>
of you, will you that I ſhould thus cure you of all this? And what do your hearts anſwer? Some, if they ſpeak their hearts, muſt anſwer, O this curing me would be the killing of me, I cannot endure to think of ſuch a change, it vexes my heart to think of parting with my beloved ſins, which are as dear as my life to me. But what ſaiſt [thou] ſinner, for thy part? Art thou one of theſe unwilling ſouls, or art thou willing that Chriſt ſhould cure thee, and cleanſe thee from all thy ſins? O get a willing heart; what art thou ſuch a ſick ſoul, and not willing of the Phyſician? ſuch a blind ſoul, and not willing to have thine eyes opened? ſuch a ſenſleſs hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoul, and not willing that Chriſt ſhould humble thee, and break thee? ſuch a vile and polluted ſoul, and not willing that Chriſt ſhould waſh thee? Art thou not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that Chriſt ſhould come and make a Saint of thee? Hath Sin made a very Devil of thee, and art not thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that Chriſt ſhould make thee a Saint? What wouldſt thou do in Heaven, if thou wilt not be made a Saint? or doſt thou think thou mayeſt continue a Devil, whileſt thou liveſt on the earth, and yet at laſt be a Saint in Heaven.</p>
            <p>What ſay you ſinners? There be ſome, it may be, of you, that have made a mock at holineſs, that have deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſaints that are on earth, and made them the objects of your ſcorn rather than your deſire, but ſpeaks man, art thou yet willing that Chriſt ſhould come this day and make [thee] a ſaint? Wilt thou that he ſhould humble thee, and bring thee to repentance? Wilt thou that he ſhould waſh thee and bring thee to holineſs? Wouldſt thou, who cameſt hither an ignorant ſinner, an hardned ſinner, an impenitent ſinner, be glad at thine heart, if thou mayſt r turn an enlightned, a convinced, yea a converted ſinner, a beleiver, a ſincere, chriſtian? Wouldſt thou carry home another heart than thou broughtſt hither, a new heart transformed and changed into the image of him that created thee, or art thou content to go home as thou cameſt ſuch an ignorant hardned polluted creature, as thou cameſt hither? If thou be heartily willing of ſuch a change as this, that is a great part of thy cure. Art thou willing to be cured, willing to be cleanſed? Then bring forth that leprous ſoul of thine, lay it at the feet of Chriſt, and ſpeak to him as the leper did. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean.</hi> As vile a ſtate as this ſoul
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48705:34"/>
of mine is in, as deadly as my diſeaſes are, as very a Leper as my ſoul is become, yet Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean. Let Chriſt hear ſuch a word from thee, <hi>Lord help me, Lord heal me, if thou wilt thou canſt;</hi> And then there is hope, that thou maieſt hear the ſame words from Chriſt, as that poor Leper did, <hi>I will, be thou clean;</hi> And immediately his Leproſie was cleanſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Take Chriſts medicines.</hi> To what purpoſe is it that the phyſitian comes to a ſick man, and preſcribes to him, and adviſeth him to what will recover him, if he will not take what he preſcribeth. Chriſt hath medicines to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſick ſouls, but his medicines muſt be taken or they will not recover them. Chriſts medicines are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His bloud.</hi> His bloud is purging and cleanſing bloud. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. Therefore he is ſaid to waſh us in his bloud. By the bloud of Chriſt is meant the ſame with the death of Chriſt. There is vertue in the death of Chriſt to deſtroy the life of ſin. <hi>Our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, Rom.</hi> 6.6. It is the body of ſin that muſt be firſt laid at; The inward pravity of our natures, our original corruption. Chriſts phyſick muſt be firſtly applyed to the root and fountain of our diſeaſe; thoſe ſinful natures, thoſe depraved habits and ſinful diſpoſitions within you, muſt be changed; The inward enmity muſt be ſlain, and there is nothing will do that, but the bloud of a crucified Ieſus. That is the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign medicine that muſt help and heal you. But how muſt this medicine the bloud of Chriſt be taken.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt himſelf muſt be taken.</hi> Chriſt offers himſelf to you to be yours, and you muſt accept of him for your own. Your hearts muſt by faith conſent unto Chriſt, to put your ſelves into his hands, to put your life into his hands, expecting and depending upon him, truſting your ſelves with him for your recovery. It is Chriſt alone, with whom I lay up all mine hopes, upon whoſe ſufficiency and faithfulneſs I will venture my ſoul: If I die, Ile die under his hand, and if I live I look for life only from him. Put your ſelves thus into the hands of Chriſt, and take Chriſt into your hearts; Take him as your own, he gives himſelf to you to be your own, Chriſt offers to every ſinner among you, I will be thine own, thine own Jeſus, thine own Saviour, if thou be willing to have me. Take him at his word; Since he ſays to thee I will be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48705:35"/>
thine own, if thou wilt, let thy heart lay hold on this bleſſed word, and ſay, <hi>content Lord,</hi> ſince thou wilt, thou ſhalt be mine own, I accept thee with all my heart. Now if Chriſt be once yours, his bloud ſhall be yours, his death ſhall be yours, and all the benefits of his death. Whereas nothing of Chriſt can be yours, nor any fruit of his death, if he be not firſt yours. Let Chriſt be once imbraced by you, and if there be any purging or cleanſing, or ſin-killing ver ue in his bloud, your ſins ſhall be purged away. If all that the bloud of Chriſt can do for thee, will recover thee, thou ſhalt be recovered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You muſt have frequent recourſe to the bloud of Chriſt, by renewed acts of faith.</hi> Look up to this crucified Jeſus, Caſt thy polluted ſoul into the fountain of his bloud. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. He is a <hi>fountain opened for ſin and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</hi> His bloud is the fountain, caſt thy ſoul into it. You are come <hi>into the bloud of ſprinkling, Heb.</hi> 12.24. Chriſtians are ſo, and they may freely lay hold on it for their cleanſing. 1. <hi>Believe that there is ſuch vertue in him to cleanſe thy ſoul:</hi> Say with the woman. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.21. If I may but touch him I ſhall be made whole. 2. <hi>Believe that it is free for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Thou mayſt come with boldneſs to him; Chriſt would have thee to be bold with him, and to lay thine help upon him. Believe that it is free for thee to lay hold on the bloud of Chriſt; and 3. <hi>Come and lay hold upon it.</hi> Lean upon him for his help, and truſt him for it. 4. <hi>Lift up a prayer to him.</hi> Lord here is a polluted dying ſoul, that is even loſt and choaked up in the mud and mire of my ſins, there is no help for me, but I muſt die and periſh in them, if thou wilt not look upon me and ſave me. In thy bowels I have hope, in thy bloud I have hope, and that is all the hope I have. O ſprinkle me with thy bloud, waſh me in thy bloud, and my ſoul ſhall live; Wherefore Lord didſt thou die? Wherefore didſt thou ſhed that precious bloud? Was it not for the recovery of loſt ſouls, for the cleanſing of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted ſouls? Is not my poor ſoul one of the number of thoſe for whom Chriſt died? Have not I as great need of of thee as any? Is it not thou thy ſelf that haſt brought this my ſoul to thy door, crying for thine help? Lord Jeſus hear, let ſome drops of that bloud, ſome of the vertue of thy death be ſhed abroad upon my ſinful heart and it ſhall live. My ſins muſt die Lord, or my ſoul will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48705:35"/>
I muſt get this luſt deſtroyed, this enmity ſlain, this proud and hard and ſtubborn heart broken, and nothing but the bloud of Chriſt the lamb will ever melt this hardneſs, or waſh me from this uncleanneſs. This will do it, and therefore here I am come before the throne of thy grace, and here I will ſtand, and look, and beg, and hope till thou hear and anſwer me, Help Lord for in thee I truſt, and look for thy ſalvation only.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His word.</hi> The word of God as it is food for ſouls, ſo it is medicine or phyſick for ſouls; And it hath in it a remedy for every diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is an awakening word to ſleepy ſouls.</hi> On theſe it thunders; that it may awaken them. Miniſters muſt be as <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſons of conſolation, ſo alſo as <hi>Boanerges</hi> ſons of thunder; And all their thunder bolts they are to have out of the word of God. O how many trumpets have been ſounded in your ears, how many thunder claps have you heard, how many thundring Sermons haſt thou heard in thy time? What, and yet art thou aſleep ſtill? Man, what is that heart of thine made of? What a dead ſleep art thou in, that art not yet awakened? This world is all aſleep, aſleep in their ſins, and therefore the Miniſters of the word are to do as the Prophet was to do, <hi>Is.</hi> 58.1. <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift thy voice like a trumpet and tell my people of their ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our firſt work is to call unto them as the mariners to Jonah, <hi>Ariſe ſleeper, careſt thou not that you periſh!</hi> Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand up from the dead. This thunder is the voice of the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.6, &amp;c. <hi>The God of glory thundereth; the voice of the Lord is powerful, the voice of the Lord is full of majeſtie, it breaketh Cedars, it maketh the wilderneſs ſhake;</hi> This word of the Lord which is his voice is a thundring voice: It breaketh the Cedars, the tall and mighty ſinners, and it ſhakes the wilderneſs, ſhakes up thoſe Beaſts of the earth out of ſleep. This ſleepy evil is the diſeaſe of ſinners, and it binds them up under a ſenſeleſſneſs of all their other diſeaſes, till the voice of the Lord doth ſhake them up out of ſleep.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is an enlightning word that giveth ſight to the blind.</hi> In this word is that <hi>eye ſalve. Rev.</hi> 1.18. Wherewith ſinners eyes are to be anointed, that they may ſee. This eye ſalve are the inſtructions of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is for the breaking and mollifying hard hearts.</hi> In the word is revealed,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48705:36"/>1. <hi>The righteouſneſs and ſeverity of God.</hi> Herein is <hi>the wrath of God revealed from heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men. Rom.</hi> 1.18. And thus it is <hi>Gods Hammer,</hi> whereby he breaks the rocks, and <hi>Gods Axe,</hi> Whereby he hews the blocks in pieces.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The goodneſs and kindneſs of God.</hi> And thus it is, <hi>Gods oyl,</hi> whereby he ſupples and diſſolves, and melts them into a plyableneſs to his will.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is for the changing the tempers and inward diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſinners.</hi> It is a transforming word, we are <hi>changed into the ſame image.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. a ſanctifying word. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is one of Chriſts medicines, and this medicine is to be taken. But what is it to take this medicine? Why, it is to hear the awakening word and to ſuffer it to work upon you, to be awakened by it, to receive the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the word, and ſo to be enlightned by it, to be broken and mollified, to be transformed and changed by it.</p>
            <p>Now this is that which I exhort you to, if you would recover, let the word of God come, let it have a free paſſage into your hearts, and let it do its work upon you. <hi>Be awakened,</hi> when you hear an awakening word, let it ſhake you up out of your ſleep. Awake ſinners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake you that ſleep, hear the voice of the Lord, and rouze you up out of that ſecure and ſenſleſs ſtate. Where is it that thou ſleepeſt? At the very mouth of the Lions Den, on the top of a Maſt. I have heard of a drunken man riding in the night on full ſpeed, he knew not whither, rode to the top of <hi>St. Vincents</hi> Rocks near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the horſe and man tumbled down; the horſe was cruſhed in pieces, the man caught by the boughs of a Tree, and there fell aſleep till morning. It was a ſtrange place to ſleep in, none but a drunken man could have ever ſlept in ſuch a place. In ſuch a deſperate ſleep art thou, as upon the brow of a Rock, on the bough of a Tree, whence thou art every moment in danger of dropping down into the deep. Sleeping ſinners, this is the caſe of every one of you; it is a wonder you have not broken your necks, that you have not fallen into the deep before this day, and yet here thou art aſleep ſtill. Awake you that ſleep, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the danger you are in. 2. <hi>Get thoſe blind eyes of yours to be opened,</hi> and receive the inſtructions of the Word.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48705:36"/>
Here we bring you eye-ſalve, be anointed with it, that you may ſee. 3. <hi>Get thoſe hard hearts to be broken and melted.</hi> Gods hammer is lifted up, lay that ſtony, that hard heart of thine under it, that it may be broken. Gods Ax is a hewing, come bring that knotty piece under it, that it may be cut &amp; clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven aſunder. Conſider the ſeverity and kindneſs of God: his ſeverity, if thou ſtill continue in thine hardneſs; if his Hammer do not break thee, his Mill-ſtones, his wrath and indignation will ſhortly grind thee to powder. Conſider his ſeverity, and conſider his goodneſs and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; what a wonder is it that after thou haſt ſo long abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the goodneſs of God, and hardned thy ſelf againſt mercy, that mercy ſhould not have given thee off, and let thee alone to periſh without remedy. It is a mercy of God, that he is yet preaching to thee of his ſeverity: it is the mercy of God that he is yet hammering and hewing at that hard heart of thine: God is ſo good and ſo kind to thee, that he hath ſent his Word once more, to trie if any good may be done upon thee: he is loth thou ſhouldſt periſh, he would fain thou ſhouldſt recover and live: he hath pity upon thee, he hath compaſſion upon that wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſoul of thine, and thence is it that he continues to be dealing with thee for thy recovery. O wonder, wonder that ſuch mercy ſhould not melt thee, that ſuch goodneſs and kindneſs ſhould not wound thee to the ſoul, that thou ſhouldſt abuſe ſuch ſtrange grace; that thou ſhould yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſtand it out againſt ſuch a God of compaſſion. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at thy ſelf and be aſhamed, wonder and be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bluſh, and weep, and fall down now at laſt, and yield unto God. What, art thou hardned ſtill? a ſtone or a ſtock ſtill? Wilt thou go away as far from remorſe, as far from repentance as thou cameſt hither? God forbid, man; God forbid, that yet thou ſhouldſt provoke the Lord farther againſt thee. Thou haſt gone away hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from many a Sabbath, thou haſt gone away hardned from many a Sermon, and muſt this Day and this Word leave thee as all the reſt have done? When doſt thou hope to be recovered, if thou wilt not be broken? Wilt thou ſay, it is no matter though I never be recovered, though I periſh and die in this hardned ſtate? Wouldſt thou fear to be let alone till thou be paſt recovery, to be loſt forever? Then yield to the ſtroke of the Word, and let thine heart be humbled and broken, and brought to repentance.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48705:37"/>4. <hi>Get the temper of your hearts to be changed.</hi> Let the Word work to the mollifying you, and to the changing of you; to the renewing you after the image of God in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and holineſs. And what ever awakenings there have been of your ſleepy conſciences, what ever light or underſtanding there may be conveyed into your minds, yea, and what ever wounds and breaches there have been made upon your hard hearts, yet till you be renewed in the very frame, and temper, and diſpoſitions of your hearts, never count your ſelves to be recovered. Thou art a loſt ſoul till thou art a ſanctified ſoul: that is, till thine heart be broken off, and brought back from the love, and luſts, and ways of this World, and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout unto God and his holy ways, till godlineſs be gotten into thine [heart] and formed into thy nature, and thou haſt a love of it, and hearty good liking of it, and the very bent of thine heart, which was formerly towards ſin and vanity, be now towards holineſs and heaven. When thou art brought to this, this new frame of heart, then thou art recovered.</p>
            <p>Now Sinners, let this be that you have in your eye, and upon your hearts, let this be your endeavour, let this be your prayer, that God would ſo bleſs his Word to you, that it may awaken your ſleepy conſciences, enlighten your blinded minds, ſoften and break your hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hearts, that you may be changed and renewed after the image of God, in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, that you may be wrought into a new temper, changed into another ſpirit, loving, and ſavouring, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the holy ways of God; that Religion may become ſweet and pleaſant to you, that your ſpirits may be made ſuitable to God and his holy ways, that the food of God may reliſh with you, and the work of God may be more eaſie to you. Sick men can neither reliſh their food, nor endure their work. Doſt thou find no reliſh in Religion, Does the work of holineſs ſeem contrary to thee? Doſt thou groan under it, as that thou canſt not bear? Doſt thou groan under this praying, and repenting, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtriving againſt ſin, and denying thy ſelf, and mortifying thy fleſh? Canſt thou not endure to be held to ſuch work? It is a ſign that thy ſickneſs is ſtill upon thee, and thou art not recovered. O get your hearts to be ſo changed and renewed by the Word and Spirit of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48705:37"/>
the Lord, that both the food of God may reliſh with you, and his work may be pleaſant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>His Rod.</hi> Sinners are fools, and the Rod is Phyſick for Fools. <hi>The rod is for the Fools back,</hi> Prov. 26.3. Pſal. 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray,</hi> but the Rod reduced me, <hi>now have I kept thy word.</hi> Sinner, thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the <hi>awakening word,</hi> but it doth not awaken thee, thou ſleepeſt on: Thou heareſt the mollifying and breaking word, but it does not break nor mollifie thee, thou art ſtill a wilful, ſtubborn ſoul, and thine heart is ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſet upon thine own looſe and wild ways, that thou wilt not be broken off thy will, nor broken off from thy courſe; but God may bring ſome affliction upon thee, bring thee into poverty, caſt thee on thy ſick bed, ſet death at thy beds foot to ſtare thee in the face, and this will tame thee: then thou mayeſt be ſpoken to, then the Word, there is hope, will enter into thee, and work upon thee. Indeed ſome ſinners are ſo deſperately hardened that neither word nor rod will do. What afflictions come, they rather ſtupifie than awaken them; They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as very ſtocks under the ſmitings of God, as they are under his teachings, and therefore take heed, the longer thou goeſt on to harden thine heart againſt the word, there is the leſs hope that thou wilt be humbled by afflictions. Dare not to encourage your ſelves and harden your hearts againſt repentance, by hopes and purpoſes that when ſickneſs comes, and death looks thee in the face, then thou wilt repent, no no, the longer thou hardneſt thy ſelf againſt the word, the leſs hope there is that thine heart will be broken by afflictions. But ſome hope there is, that when the word awakens not, the rod may. But if that do not neither, then God be merciful unto thee, there is but one thing more and that will certainly do it, the unquenchable flames will awaken thee, Hell will do that which all the means under Heaven cannot do; But that fire will not be thy phyſick to cure thee, but thy plague to kill thy ſoul for ever.</p>
            <p>The afflictions of this life are Gods phyſick for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering thy ſoul; O take this cup at the hand of the Lord, take this phyſick for thy ſoul; But what is it to take this medicine ſo as it may be recovering phyſick?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Submit to afflictions when God lays them on.</hi> Be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and contented that the Lord ſhould afflict thee. Do
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48705:38"/>
not fret nor murmur at the afflcting hand of God. Some froward patients, if their Phyſitian be forced to give any harder phyſick it will not down, but they fret and fume againſt the phyſitian, as if he were cruel, and will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to take what he offers them. Be patient under the hand of God, and ſubmit to what ever he layes on.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider thine afflictions. Eccl.</hi> 7.14. <hi>In the day of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity conſider.</hi> Affliction is a conſidering time. Sinners, you will not conſider now, but you may have time enough to conſider it afterwards.

Think of what you hear, think what a wretched caſe the word declares you to be in. When you hear ſuch words, <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil,</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>He that liveth after the fleſh ſhall die. Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>He that is not born again, cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> When you hear ſuch words as theſe, then conſider, then think with your ſelf, what a word have I heard to day? Am not I concerned in it? Was not this word ſpoken to me? Am not I one that committeth ſin? Do not I live after the fleſh? Was I ever regenerated or born again? What then? Why, then think farther, Is it nothing to be of the Devil? Is everlaſting death nothing? Is it nothing to be ſhut out of the kingdom of God? Awaken O my ſleepy ſoul; yet break and melt and tremble; oh mine hardned heart, awaken, eſcape for thy Life, there is but a ſtep betwixt thee and everlaſting death. Conſider this now, whilſt the day of adverſity comes nor, but if thou ſhouldſt be ſo unwiſe as not to conſider at preſent, yet at leaſt in the day of thy diſtreſs conſider; Then think how little the word hath done to the breaking and awakening of thee; What a ſtock, what a ſenſeleſs ſtone hath it left thee! Then think, now God is uſing one means more to cure me of this ſleepy hardned heart, God hath laid this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon me, or this poverty upon me, to humble me
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48705:38"/>
and awaken me; And now I am come to my laſt remedy, if affliction, if diſtreſs, if ſickneſs, if the ſight of death, and the grave do not work upon me, nor cauſe the word which I have heard to work yet upon me, what then? Why then I am undone forever, I am within a ſtep of the Pit, juſt dropping in, and then this loſt ſoul of mine will be paſt recovery forever.</p>
            <p>O ſinners how does this word ſit upon your hearts? Are not you greatly concerned in it? Does not thy life lie at ſtake, thy ſoul lie at ſtake, upon thy conſidering or ſlighting thy warning? O conſider, let preſent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevent the great neceſſity of ſickneſs conſideration, of death-bed conſideration. At leaſt when any of you ſhall come to be in diſtreſs, when pains ſhall come upon you or poverty come upon you, or death make its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to you, then remember the warning of this day.

Come off from this greedy worldly life, feed not your ſouls upon your lands, or your monies, or your trades; Though you muſt have ſomething of theſe for your bodies, yet feed not your hearts with them.

Never count you have thought of God to any purpoſe, till you can love, and taſte, and get out good nouriſhment for your ſouls, by which you may thrive and flouriſh, and with which you may be ſo delighted, as to wean you from the Love and Luſts of this world.</p>
            <p>Believe it friends, as loth as you are to let go your pleaſant morſels, the ſtolen waters of your own Ciſterns, as hard as you find it to diet your ſouls, ſo as to deny your ſelves the pleaſures and contentments of a worldly fleſhly life, as ſtrongly as your hearts luſt after eaſe, and luſt after the world and the contentments thereof, get but once to be ſo inwardly acquainted with religion, as to taſte the pleaſure thereof, and you will be able to deſpiſe this carnal life, and all its advantages, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at your ſelves, that ever you ſhould find out content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a life as you have lived.</p>
            <p>And now your ſouls are like to flouriſh amain, when you are come to this once, to diſrelliſh your old delights, and to feed your thoughts and feed your affections on things above, and to forbear, and come off from the love and luſts and companions and pleaſures of this world, then you will live and thrive and flouriſh in the Houſe of the Lord, and grow up before him as his peculiar children whom the Lord hath ſaved.</p>

well as the ſick body. Prayer is a ſtirring exerciſe, that (if performed as it ought) ſets all the powers of the ſoul on work; it is a ſtriving with God, it is a wreſtling with God, it is the lifting up of the heart, and the pouring out the ſoul to God. When thou ſetteſt thy ſelf to praying, it is both a ſign that thy recovery is begun, and an hope it will be perfected. Set your ſelves to praying, Sinners, ſtir up your ſelves to prayer; <hi>There is none that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold on thee, Iſ.</hi> 64.7. Pray and ſtir up your ſelves in prayer.

What if the cry of my ſins ſhould be louder than the cry of my prayers? I come for the pardon of my ſins, I come for power againſt ſin, I am begging my life, and the ſaving my ſoul from going down into the Pit; my very life, my ſoul lies at ſtake, if God ſhould not hear me, I am loſt for ever.

            <p>Plead with God, poor ſinner, for that poor miſerable ſoul of thine, plead with him upon his mercies, upon his bowels, upon his promiſes, upon the bloud of Chriſt. Take unto thee words, Lord I am a miſerable ſinful ſoul, I am a loſt creature, I am ſick unto death, I am bound in the chains of my ſins, and cannot get looſe, I am a blind, hardned, defiled creature; theſe eyes muſt be opened, this heart muſt be broken, this filth and pollution muſt be waſhed away, or I ſhall be ſwallowed up of the pit. Where are thy bowels, O Lord? Art thou a God of pity, and haſt thou no pity for me? Where is thy promiſe, Lord? Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Ask and you ſhall have, ſeek and you ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> To whom haſt thou ſpoken this word? Is it not to me as well as to others? Where is the bloud of Chriſt, doth it not ſpeak for ſinners? Doth it not make interceſſion for tranſgreſſors? It doth Lord, thou haſt ſaid it doth. And what doth this bloud ſpeak? Lord forgive this poor ſinner that comes to thee for pardon; Lord purge him with thy bloud, Lord heal him with thy bloud, Lord give him that new heart and life which he comes for. O, doth this precious bloud ſpeak thus for me, and wilt thou not hear?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48705:40"/>Sinners, if ever you would be recovered, ſet upon this exerciſe, and keep you to it. Go to God this night, be with him again to morrow morning, and again in the evening, and every day as duly as the day comes, go alone and retire your ſelves into the preſence of God, fall upon your knees, and pour forth your ſouls in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to him. Beware you neither neglect it, and beware you do not trifle at it: do not deceive your ſelves with the ſhadow or image of Prayer in ſtead of Prayer. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, thou art upon a matter of life and death when thou goeſt to prayer; and let that awaken and ſtir up all thy powers in it.</p>
            <p>Friends, I doubt either that you do not pray, or that it is but mock-praying, that too many of you ſatisfie your ſelves withal. O what pitiful, haſty, ſhort, dead pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is it, that thou ſatisfieſt thy ſelf with? Trace thy ſelf into thy praying corners, conſider how ſeldom thou art there, how quickly thou haſt done, how miſerably thou ſhuffleſt over thy duties, without life or affection; what is this but mock-prayer, will ſuch praying recover thy loſt ſoul? No, thou ſeeſt it will not: thou art the ſame man, of the ſame ſpirit, running the ſame courſe, from one week to another, from one year to another, without any change for the better. It may be ſaid of ſuch praying, as it was ſaid of the falſe Prophets preaching, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.14. <hi>They heal the hurt of my people ſlightly.</hi> Slight praying is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended but with ſlight healing: ſomething it ſeems to do, it skins over the wound that it ſmart not for the time, it keeps people quiet for the time, but it will never work a thorough cure. Your wound is deeper, your diſeaſe is eaten into your fleſh and your bone, to your heart and your ſoul, and your medicine muſt go as deep as your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. There muſt be deep ſighs and groans, and deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that muſt come up from the bottom of your hearts, or they will never reach the bottom of your diſeaſe. Be aſhamed of your ſlightneſs, be aſhamed of your folly, that you ſhould ever think that God would help you the ſooner for ſuch trifling and mocking prayers.</p>
            <p>Oh pray, and exerciſe your ſelves in prayer. Stir up all within you to this work; look to your ſelves, I am afraid that this duty, which is a means of recovery, may prove the loſs of your ſouls: I am afraid leſt the Lord, the jealous God that will not be mocked, I am afraid that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48705:41"/>
he may damn you for your prayers, your trifling mocking prayers. Dare not to trifle any longer; dare not for thy life, that the Lord ever again meet thee in thy cloſet, meet thee on thy knees with nothing but the ſacrifice of Fools, a few heartleſs words upon thy lips. Beloved I can hardly paſs over this word thus, there being ſo much weight lying upon it, and yet there being ſo much hardneſs of heart under this ſoul-deceiving and ſoul-dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning practice ſhuffling in prayer. What ſay you? Have I ſaid enough yet? Are you yet made ſenſible how much you are, many of you, concerned in this word? Are you yet ſenſible how greatly guilty you are of this miſerable hypocriſie? Will all that I have ſaid yet do, to bring you to be ſerious and in good earneſt in every prayer you make? Are you come to this, well, I hope I ſhall mock God no more, I hope I ſhall trifle in prayer no more? Are you reſolved to put your hearts to it, and to trie what you can do, and never leave trying till you are come to it, to make every prayer, one of the moſt ſerious and hearty exerciſes of your life? Then would there be hope of recovery out of all your diſeaſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Exerciſe your ſelves to repentance.</hi> Repentance ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a change, a change of the mind originally; ſo thoſe two words by which it is expreſſed in Scripture, ſignifie <hi>poſt factum ſapere,</hi> after we have plaid the fools by ſin, to come to be wiſe, ſo wiſe as to ſee our folly, ſo to ſee our folly as to grieve for it, and ſo to grieve, <hi>ut corrigere,</hi> to amend and do ſo no more. This change is ordinarily brought on by convulſions and troubleſome commotions in the heart; there is a ſorrow that works this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repentance to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This Repentance is not diſpatched all at once, but is carried on and perfected by degrees.

An exerciſe as it reſpects our own acts, which this grace cauſeth us to put forth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>This ſelf-ſame thing, that ye ſorrowed after a godly manner, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your ſelves, what indignation, what fear, what deſire, what zeal, what revenge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Get the grace of repentance, and live in the daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of repentance.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48705:41"/>1. <hi>Keep your minds working, to maintain that change that is begun.</hi> Have you ſeen the folly of ſin, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of ſin, and how much better it is to turn and come about from it to holineſs? Are you come to be of this judgment, that you were mad to follow the Devil, and your luſts; that you could never have lived in ſuch a ſtate, and gone on in ſuch a courſe as you have, unleſs you had been mad men? Are you gotten into ſo good a mind? Keep you in it. <hi>Exerciſe your thoughts,</hi> caſt an eye back upon your former evils, and that which God hath made known to you of the miſery of them. Think often what it is to be a loſt ſoul, a captive to the Devil; think what a Fool, what a Beaſt thou wert whileſt thou livedſt ſuch a proud, and covetous, and carnal, ſenſual, laſcivious, and ſottiſh life: and by ſuch thoughts make thy ſelf as odious to thy ſelf as thou canſt; get to a loathing and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thy evil ways. This is that which is promiſed <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They ſhall loath themſelves,</hi> for the evils they have committed.</p>
            <p>Get this ſelf loathing by ſtudying and remembring what thou waſt, and ripping up all thine old ſores, that fooliſh filthy heart and life of thine; hereby work thy ſelf to this loathing, and maintain a conſtant diſguſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of thy former ſtate. Art thou now in ſo good a mind, as to hate thy ſelf for thy ſin? be never reconciled to it, ſo as ever to think good thoughts of thy evil ways as long as thou liveſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Exerciſe your affections:</hi> Your ſorrow for ſin, your fear of ſin, your indignation or anger againſt ſin your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after power and victory over it. Keep theſe penitent affections working, maintain that godly ſorrow, and fear, and indignation: Keep your ſorrow alive, keep your fears working, and your indignation burning againſt your iniquities. Let theſe zealous paſſions and affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, be ſo raiſed, as never to be allayed; let the fire of your holy jealouſie be ſo kindled, as never to be quenched; let the thoughts of the evil and odiouſneſs of ſin, be the fuel to keep that holy fire burning, and the Bellows to blow it up into a greater flame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Exerciſe your care and conſideration</hi> how you may compleat and confirm your recovery. The word it may be, is but yet begun with you; You do but begin to be wiſe, begin to be ſober and ſerious; there is many a good
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48705:42"/>
and hopeful beginning goes back, and comes to nothing; live in a dayly care of reforming and amending farther what hath been amiſs. The top of repentance ſtandeth in amendment, if you ſhould ſee your ſins to be fooliſh, and odious never ſo much, if you ſhould be grieved and aſhamed of your ſelves for them, if the thoughts of the courſe you have lived, ſhould make you afraid, and ſet you a trembling over your old wonted ſtate and way, if you do not amend that is no repentance. If you ſhould ſay, I hate ſin, and hate my ſelf for it, I hate my ſelf for this pride, I hate my ſelf for this covetouſneſs, I hate my ſelf for this frowardneſs, and yet you have not the power to reſiſt it, and come off from it, you ſorrow and ſin, you fear and ſin, you are angry with your ſelf for ſin, and yet go on; this is no repentance. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his wickedneſs &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The top of repentance ſtands in amendment, and the amendment of repentance, muſt be compleating every day. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.5. <hi>If ye throughly amend your ways, if ye throughly execute Judgment &amp;c. Then will I cauſe you to dwell in the Land.</hi> It is not an half recovery, a partial amendment, but a perfect recovery that muſt be in your eye. There is a great difference betwixt theſe two, <hi>being upon recovery,</hi> and <hi>being recovered.</hi> Are you upon recovery? it is well you are, it is more than the moſt of ſinners are; there is not the leaſt ſign of recovery, there is not the leaſt ſign of amendment, there are nothing but death tokens upon them. Sinners I doubt this may be many of your caſes, you are not ſo much as beginning to recover; your diſeaſe is ſtill in its ſtrength, and growing upon you; you are not amending, but you are hardning dayly in your ſins, going on to have leſs ſenſe, and ſo leſs hope of a cure. But art thou O ſinner, art thou upon recovery? It is well thou art; but let not that ſatisfie thee, that thou art upon the recovering hand, but get thee to be recovered. And this is that you are to be exerciſing your ſelf in, to get you to be on the mending hand every day; labour to grow better and better, not only to get a deeper ſenſe of ſin, but to get more power over ſin, more victory over your evil hearts, more contempt of the world and its temptations, more ſcorn of your carnal companions, and more indignation againſt a carnal ſenſual life, and more firmneſs and reſolvedneſs of heart, to have done with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48705:42"/>
every evil and vain way, and the temptations to it. I ſay, the temptations to it, for whatever oppoſition there ſeems to be of the heart againſt ſin, yet if there be a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing upon temptations, if thou thinkeſt thou hateſt drunkenneſs or a jolly vain life, and yet wilt be thruſting in amongſt thoſe that are ſuch, if thou ſayſt thou hateſt this worldly mindedneſs, and yet art never well but when thou art greedily heaping up what ſhould feed thy worldly diſeaſe, never talk of hating the ſin; if thou fear not, if thou ſhun not the temptation, thou ſtill loveſt the ſin.</p>
            <p>Well ſinners, ſet your hearts upon a perfect amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and keep your ſelves in ſuch a conſtant exerciſe of repentance, that you may amend more and more every day. Conſider, is it better with thee to day than it was yeſterday? or at leaſt, is it better with thee this year than it was laſt year, or ſome years agone? Is it better or is it worſe? Or art thou in the ſame caſe? What hope haſt thou to be recovered, if there be no amendment all this while?</p>
            <p>To provoke you to the preſent and conſtant exerciſing your ſelves to repentance. I will propoſe ſome queſtions to you.</p>
            <p>Q. 1, <hi>What do you think of your former ſtate, and your ways hitherto?</hi> Is it well with you? Are you not loſt ſouls, and your carnal ways are they not the ways of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Have ye lived like wiſe underſtanding men? Do ye think ye have? Will you ſay, I have done wiſely in following the wine and ſtrong drink, in following my companions and my pleaſures? I have dealt wiſely to live ſuch a covetous and worldly life, I ſhould have been a fool to have been a Chriſtian, or a convert, to have left all and have followed Chriſt, from my firſt time! You have liv'd a fleſhly and worldly life you cannot deny that, but let me ask you as the Apoſtle did the <hi>Romans. Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What fruit had ye of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed.</hi> Are you come ſo far towards repentance as to be aſhamed of your former folly? What fruit have you? What is there now remaining to you, as the fruit of your former ways? O I have ſome good fruit, I hope I have lived a worldly life I have got the world about me, I have got me an eſtate, and am become a rich man, I ſhould have been poor enough, if I had hearkned to Chriſt and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48705:43"/>
come back from the world ſooner, this houſe is the fruit, this money is the fruit, theſe lands are the fruits of my labors. Would praying and repenting and forſaking the world, have ever brought me to ſuch an eſtate as now I have? And do you yet ask me what fruit have ye of your worldlineſs!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. But are theſe the fruits you can ſatisfie your ſelves in? Are theſe the fruits you can bleſs your ſelves in? Will theſe eſtates anſwer for you to your Judge? And make way for you into the everlaſting Kingdom? Will this be a good plea for entrance into Heaven, ſet open the door for here comes a rich man, a monied man, a landed man, let him have entrance into the Everlaſting Kingdom? Freinds, what you have thus gotten, will ſink you, and drown you in perdition, and deſtruction, but never he p you to glory, and this is the good fruit you boaſt of, that you have gotten ſuch weights about your necks, as will drown you in the Pit.</p>
            <p>But 2. What fruit have [you] of your ways that have lived at eaſe, and lived in pleaſure, in idleneſs or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, or exceſs of riot, in ſporting and laughing, and carnal jollity? What is become of all the pleaſures of your life? What fruit is there remaining of all thy crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thorns? Are they not all burnt to aſhes and vaniſhed away as a dream?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Have all your former ways done any thing to the recovering of your loſt ſouls? Have not they left you ſons of perdition, nay, are you not become ſeven times more the children of Hell by theſe practiſes than you were by nature? Thou wert naturally a child of wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. and you have by practice been children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, as <hi>verſe</hi> 2. and hath your diſobedience deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered you from wrath?</p>
            <p>I ſay therefore again, What do you think of your ſelves, and your ways. The Judgment of God, you ſee what it is, you are a child of diſobedience, and a child of wrath, and what is your Judgment? What are your own thoughts of your ſelves? Does not your Judgment, and your conſcience tell you, ſure it is an evil caſe that I am in? No wiſe man would ever ſtay a minute longer in ſuch a ſtate or way. Have you come ſo far towards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as to change your mind? Are there any of you of better minds than you have been? Is this now your
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48705:43"/>
mind and your ſetled judgment, It would be good for me to repent, and come about to God? Have you any mind to Chriſt, any mind to godlineſs, and ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity?</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Will you continue in your former ſtate and way, or will you endeavour for recovery?</hi> If you ſay you have a mind to be a Convert and become a new man, will you ſet your hearts to it, will you exerciſe your thoughts about it? will you ſet to praying for repentance, to reſiſting and ſtriving againſt your old ſins? Will you go on as before, or will you come back? Who is there among you that hath yet the heart to ſay, O I have done with my old ways, I have done with my old companions, I have done with this World, I have done with this fleſhly life, I am aſhamed, I am afraid, I repent that I have lived ſuch a life hitherto: the Lord change my heart, the Lord help me to change my way. What ſay you Chriſtians, it is an important queſtion to anſwer, the Lord God puts you this day to it, to be plain and downright, and in good earneſt to reſolve what you will do. What ſay you? Who of you are for repenting, and who for going on in your ſins? God puts you to it, and in the name of God put your ſelves to it, to give in your anſwer. What do you mean to do, will you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Lord, or will you yet go on to harden your hearts? Have theſe words ſo far prevailed upon you, as to bring you into a good mind? Have you a mind and purpoſe to return.</p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>Shall it ſuffice you to take up with the beginnings of repentance, or will you make thorough-work.</hi> Shall it ſuffice you to ſet your faces towards God, or will you come home to him? <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.1. <hi>O Iſrael, if thou wilt return, return unto [me.]</hi> Come not towards me, and then ſtay at half way; but come home to <hi>me,</hi> come thorough to <hi>me.</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is diſpatched by degrees; firſt thoſe that were running away are brought about to be <hi>looking,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards God; then thoſe that are afar off, are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near</hi> to God; then thoſe that are come near, do <hi>come in</hi> to God; and then thoſe that are come in, do by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>fix</hi> and confirm their hearts upon God, that they may never go back to the way of ſin.</p>
            <p>What is it that will ſatisfie you? Shall it ſuffice you to be looking towards God, or coming half way towards Heaven? or are you for coming home, for coming in to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48705:44"/>
Lord? for making ſure work, for making thorough work? If you are ſo, for being thorough-Converts, this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire time, this will require pains, and conſtant exerciſing your ſelves to repentance as long as you live. You muſt continue repenting, as long as you continue ſinning; you muſt confirm and eſtabliſh your hearts againſt all returns to the old ſtate and courſe, as long as there is danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing. What if you ſhould begin well, and then give off or make a ſtand? What if you ſhould lay by your ſorrow for ſin, lay down your fear of ſin, and run into temptations to ſin without fear, if you ſhould give off your watch and your warrings againſt ſin? What do you think would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you if you ſhould? How would you tumble back into the Pit, from which you ſeemed to be delivered? Do what you can Friends, to make ſure work; Have you got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any ſenſe of ſin, and of the neceſſity of turning? Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your thoughts and your hearts upon this thing while you live. You will never whilſt you live here, ſee to the bottom of the evil that is in ſin. Haſt thou by thinking, and ſearching, found out ſomething of the evil of ſin? Think again, ſearch again, and thou ſhalt yet ſee greater abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, greater malignity in it. You may as eaſily ſee to the height of heaven, or to the depth of hell, as to the bottom of ſin. Sin can never be thoroughly known till God be thoroughly known. It is an abuſe of God, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of infinite grace, and goodneſs, and holineſs: as often as thou ſinneſt, thou affronteſt and abuſeſt the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth. Thou thinkeſt it a ſmall matter to tell a lie, or to pilfer and purloin, if it be but trifles thou ſtealeſt; but is it a ſmall matter to abuſe the Almighty God? to tread upon his authority, who hath ſaid, lie not, thou ſhalt not ſteal, thou ſhalt not covet? Is it a ſmall matter to ſpit in his face, to ſlight his bowels, to tread upon his mercy, and to throw it back upon him, and refuſe it when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it? Such and much more malignity is there in ſin than all this, and therefore be thinking and ſearching out the evil of ſin more and more, as long as you live. Study much the evil of ſin, and the preciouſneſs of Chriſt, and give not over till you can no longer either make light of ſin, or make light of Chriſt; and when ſin is become grievous, and Chriſt is become pretious; when ſin is ſo grievous that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear it, when Chriſt is ſo pretious that you cannot want him, that is a ſign of a recovered ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48705:44"/>
               <hi>To them which believe he is pretious.</hi> And where Chriſt is pretious, it is ſure there ſin is odious. O if Chriſt hath once recovered you, how dear will he be to you? You will prize him in your very hearts, you will love him while you live, you will be afraid how you grieve or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. And when you are recovered from ſin, how will you look back upon it? will you love, will you luſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your old ways again? Will you wiſh your ſelves Worldlings again, Senſualiſts again? Will you bethink the eaſe you have loſt, the pleaſures you have loſt, the companions you have loſt? Will you not thank God that you are come out from among them, and have eſcaped that miſery that is coming upon the World? The more you live in the conſtant exerciſe of repentance, the more you will admire the recovering grace of God, and the more you will abhor to return to folly.</p>
            <p>Repentance is your recovery, if God give you repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, you may recover, and your continuing in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of repentance is your maintaining, and perfecting, and confirming your recovery. You are not gotten ſo far off from the ſtate of ſin, but your continued exerciſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will get you farther off daily. Your repentance is your getting upon ſure ground, and your continued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is your ſtanding your ground; your giving off at your repenting work will be your relapſe, and it may be into a worſe caſe than before, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Behold thou art made whole, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> Behold thou art made whole, O what a word is that? How do you think that poor impotent man, that had been ſo 38 years, was raviſhed at that word? What if the Lord ſhould now ſpeak the word to any ſinner among you that had been even aſtoniſhed with the ſenſe of his ſin and his guilt; that had lien as long at the Ordinances as the poor man at the Pool, expecting and hoping for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving change, and could find none. If Chriſt ſhould come to thee this day, and ſay, <hi>Behold thou art made-whole,</hi> thy ſins are forgiven, and thy ſoul is cleanſed from them; If that word ſhould be ſpoken to thee this day, how would thine heart leap for joy? What ſhould we hear from thee but praiſes and thankſgiving? Well, but yet conſider the words that follow, <hi>ſin no more,</hi> ſtand thy ground, <hi>leſt a worſe thing come to thee:</hi> thy caſe hath been very ſad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but as ſad as it hath been, look to find it worſe,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48705:45"/>
if thou return to folly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>God will ſpeak peace, but let them not return to folly:</hi> at their peril let them look to it, that they do not return. But of this more in the next.</p>
            <p>Now Sinners, will you yet at laſt be perſuaded to ſet upon this work of repenting? Will you ſay you cannot? Why then you muſt die of your diſeaſe, die eternally. But why, can you not? O it is a painful life, it is contrary to me, I have found ſuch eaſe and ſuch pleaſure, and ſuch gain in mine old ways, that I cannot part with them: what, not for the ſaving of thy life? Is thine eaſe better than Chriſt? Are thy gains more worth than thy ſoul? Wilt thou to hell rather than turn? As ſure as thou liveſt thither thou muſt, if thou repent not, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> God hath ſaid, <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die, Ezek.</hi> 18. and God will never repent of that word as to thee unleſs thou repent of thy ſins. What, art thou reſolved for hell? Art thou reſolved to ſacrifice that fleſh and thoſe bones of thine to the fury of the Devil? Art thou a captive to the Devil, and wilt thou never recover out of his ſnares? Shall he carry thee with him to his home? Shall be that hath had the leading of thee, have the burning of thee? O why will ye die? Turn and live, count upon it, there is but one way with you, every one of you, either turn or die.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Exerciſe your ſelves to the keeping a good conſcience.</hi> Acts 24.26. <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an hard exerciſe and will hold us in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual work. There are many things required to the keeping a good conſcience, all which muſt be well looked to. Amongſt others,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Get a good conſcience;</hi> or get conſcience recovered from thoſe evils it labours under. There are two ſpecial evils in and upon conſcience.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Guilt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Guile.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Guilt,</hi> there is guilt upon the conſcience, every ſin leaves guilt behind it, The whole world is <hi>become guilty before God. Rom.</hi> 3.15. Becauſe the whole world are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or ſubject to the Judgment of God. But then there is <hi>guilt upon the man, and guilt upon the conſcience.</hi> There are ſome ſins, that leave guilt upon the man, but do not, immediatly leave guilt upon the conſcience as ſins of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, theſe leave guilt upon the man, but not allways
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48705:45"/>
upon the conſcience, becauſe ſuch ſins conſcience does not, nor can take notice of, and ſo they cannot be called ſins againſt conſcience. Guilt there is upon conſcience: 1. When conſcience through remiſſneſs or neglect does not take notice of them, nor charge the ſoul to take heed of them. 2. When though conſcience does know ſin to be ſin, and thoſe particular acts, that I am tempted to, to be ſinful acts, yet luſt prevails to bring us on upon the commiſſion of them againſt conſcience. Thou knoweſt that lying is a ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy conſcience tells thee ſo and yet thou wilt lye; Thou knoweſt that drunkenneſs, that defrauding, that profaning the ſabbath, that neglect to pray, and to hear, are ſins; And thy conſcience tells thee they are, and yet thou wilt lye, or be drunk, or work, or travel upon the Lords day, neglect to pray, &amp;c. This leaves a guilt upon thy conſcience. O how great, O how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful guilt is there upon the conſciences of many of us? How many bills of indictment will thy conſcience have, to bring forth againſt thee before thy Judge? The guilt of neglecting Chriſt, the guilt of hardning thy heart againſt mercy, beſides all the guilt of thine oaths, and of thy drunkenneſs, and of thy covetouſneſs, and of thy lying, and ſtealing and ſcoffing, all this guilt lyes upon thee, and this is one thing that conſcience muſt be recovered from, ere it can be a good conſcience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Guile,</hi> or falſhood, or treachery of conſcience. Conſcience will juggle and deal deceitfully, it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with, or give allowance of ſin, it will connive and wink at iniquity. Some ſins which can be better ſpared, it reſiſts, others, ſuch as intereſt or inclination lead more ſtrongly to, it lets them paſs, and will not ſee them to be ſin, and therefore dares not examine whether they be ſin or no. This is a guileful conſcience, it is true of Chriſtians what is ſaid of <hi>Nathaniel. Joh.</hi> 1.47. <hi>An Iſraelite indeed in whom there is no guile. Pſal.</hi> 32.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</hi> This is a good conſcience, that is plain and honeſt and faithful. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. <hi>We truſt ye have a good conſcience in all things willing to live honeſtly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe being the diſeaſes in conſcience, guilt and guile, from theſe we muſt get them recovered, and their recovery muſt be wrought, <hi>by bloud and water.</hi> By the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48705:46"/>
loud of Chriſt purge your conſciences?</hi> And <hi>by water alſo,</hi> by he water of ſanctification, and by the water of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Penitent tears have their uſe to the waſhing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Sinners take heed, have no guilt upon your conſciences, have you no guile in your conſciences. O how dreadfully guilty, O how miſerably guileful hath that conſcience of thine been! Get your conſciences purged, get the bloud of Chriſt to be ſprinkled upon them. Draw water, ſo the pouring forth penitent tears is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6. <hi>They drew water and poured it forth before the Lord and faſted that day.</hi> Draw water ſinners, weep before the Lord for your ſins, and this will be the waſhing your conſciences from the guilt and guile that is upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Keep conſcience working?</hi> Though method would require that I ſpeak to this, of <hi>keeping conſcience</hi> under the next general, <hi>the keeping of the heart</hi> yet I chooſe rather to ſpeak to it here. Keep conſcience working. A lazy ſleeping conſcience is good for nothing, it is a ſtirring working conſcience that does its office, that muſt induſtriouſly be maintained. Conſcience hath

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>An eye.</hi> And the eye of conſcience muſt be kept open The eye of conſcience is even as the eye of God, it may be ſaid of conſcience in its meaſure, as of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2.3. <hi>Thou knoweſt my down fitting and upriſing, thou underſtandeſt my thoughts, and art acquainted with all my wayes.</hi> The eye of conſcience beholds our very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, all things are naked and open, even before that conſcience with which we have to do, and this is ſomthing you have to keep you doing, to keep the eye of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence open. Let not conſcience wink at your follies, let it ſee and obſerve what ever you do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Book.</hi> A Regiſter or book of records, where it writes down what it ſees. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. <hi>The ſin of Judah is written</hi>— It is graven upon the tables of the hearts, the meaning there is, it hath entered into their hearts, it hath corrupted and eaten into their hearts, there are the ſcars and impreſſions of it upon them; Their iniquities have marked them, and marked them in their very hearts
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48705:46"/>
for vile and ungodly ones. This graving of ſin upon the heart, notes the hearts defilement; the corrupting of the heart; But then there is a writing for remembrance, a writing of ſcores, or books of account; and thus mens ſins are written in the book of conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now this alſo muſt be looked to, that conſcience be faithful, and book down all our ſins, that they may be remembred by us and repented of.</p>
            <p>The book of conſcience will be written, whether men will or no, if conſcience will be negligent, and will not write down its own faults, God will do it and will write down all our ſins, if conſcience will not; If we mark not, God will mark them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is marked before [me].</hi> If we record not, God will record them. What conſcience writes conſcience may read and remember, but what God writes (upon the neglect of conſcience) ſinners cannot read, or remember now, but there it ſhall all be to be ſeen at the great day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, when the book ſhall be opened, and read before Angels and men.</p>
            <p>Sinners, what is there written in thoſe books within you? Are your ſins written there? Hath conſcience kept a record of them? It is well if it have; look into that book, read over and remember all your ways; go and ask thy conſcience, if thou haſt not been a Lyar, if thou haſt not been a ſwearer, a Drunkard, a covetous liver, a fleſh pleaſer, ask thy conſcience if it hath not been ſo. How many have been thy lyes, how many have been thine oathes, how many drunken bouts, how many rioting days how many greedy and covetous practices, haſt thou been guilty of? Look into that book in thy boſom; if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath been faithful there thou maieſt read and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and ſo come to be humbled for them. But if conſcience hath not noted theſe things, but hath been aſleep, and let thee alone to run thy courſe, without its keeping an account, yet God hath written down all. Though thou haſt forgotten what thou haſt been, though thou haſt forgotten or taken no notice of what thou haſt done, yet God hath his book of remembrance againſt thee, thine iniquities are all marked before him <hi>Theſe things thou haſt done and I kept ſilence, but I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thee, and ſet thy ſins in order before thee, Pſal.</hi> 50.21— The Lord ſtood by and ſaw thee, when thou wert in thy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48705:47"/>
cups, the Lord hearkened and heard all thine oaths, &amp; thy lies, and though he kept ſilence, and let thee alone for the time, and ſaid little to reprove or affright thee, yet thou ſhalt ſee, and know, that he ſaw thee where ever thou were, and marked what ever thou haſt done, thou ſhalt know it by this, that he will hereafter reprove thee and ſet all thy ſins in order before thee. And O what a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight will that be, when thou ſhalt have the black roll of all the wickedneſs that thou haſt done in thy life, at once preſented to thy view. Now you would be ready to ſay, I know nothing by my ſelf, or no great matters at leaſt, thou haſt but a few things againſt thy ſelf, and thoſe few thou counteſt ſmall matters; But when God ſhall bring forth the whole roll, and force thee to read every line, and to ſee every ſin in its colours, then ſhalt thou ſee every one of thy ſins, as ſo many Devils to torment thee forever. Sinner how doſt thou think thou ſhalt look in that day? how will thy face grow pale, and thy countenance be changed, and thy bones tremble at ſuch an horrid ſight of all thy ſins at once? O prevent this miſery by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Conſcience to be faithful; let Conſcience keep its Book open, and write down all thy ways, that there thou maiſt read them at preſent, and remember them in order to thy repentance, and their being blotted out by the bloud of the Lamb.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A Tongue.</hi> Conſcience is called by a Proverb, <hi>the Preacher in the boſom:</hi> How ſhall this Preacher preach if he hath not a tongue to ſpeak? God be merciful to thoſe Congregations which have dumb Prieſts, and to thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that have dumb Conſciences. How long may poor Congregations ſit under a dumb Prieſt, ere they hear any thing to purpoſe, either of their duty or their faults? they may be blind and ignorant ſouls, and never hear one word of inſtruction, or of the danger of their ignorance; they may be without Chriſt, and without God in the World, and ſo may continue to their dying day, and never hear one word to bring them to Chriſt, or turn them to God. They may be Liars, Drunkards, Swearers, Sabbath-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, or what they will; and whatever they be, they never hear a word to bring them to repentance. They may live without prayer, reading, or ſo much as thinking of God, or their everlaſting ſtate, and not a word ſpoken to bring them to theſe neceſſary duties. And juſt thus
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48705:47"/>
ſadly it fares, with people that are under dumb conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They may do what they will, be as wicked as they will, and conſcience lets them alone. Sinner, doſt thou not find this to be true, in thy caſe? Thou canſt go all thy days without ſerious prayer, no prayer in ſecret, no prayer in the family, thou canſt live in this reſpect, like a very heathen, and thou canſt lye, and ſwear, and drink, and ſcoff, and be covetous, and what ſays conſcience to all this? Not a word. Thy conſcience may ſay in its wickedneſs, as God ſaid in his righteouſneſs, <hi>Theſe things thou haſt done and I kept ſilence.</hi> Such mens conſciences, it may be ſaid of them as concerning David towards his ſon <hi>Adonijah.</hi> 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 1.6. <hi>His father had not diſpleaſed him at any time, in ſaying why haſt thou done ſo.</hi> Mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will not diſpleaſe them, will not diſpleaſe their luſts, but will let them alone, and ſay nothing to them, good nor bad. How often doſt thou hear of thy conſcience? When did it check thee, or reprove thee, or warn thee? When doſt thou hear ſuch a word within thee, <hi>How ſhall I do this wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi> With what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can I be thus falſe or fraudulent, or froward? With what conſcience can I keep ſuch vain or lewd company? With what conſcience can I live without prayer, or any thing of the worſhip of God in my houſe? Is there any conſcience in this lying, or promiſe-breaking, or deceitful dealing? Is there any conſcience in this idle careleſs life, to live thus in the neglect of God and my ſoul? When doſt thou hear ſuch a word within thee? thou haſt a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuch as it is, but it hath loſt its tongue, and will not reprove thee, or warn thee, but let thee alone to follow thy luſt and humour, without controul; and in what a woful caſe art thou, that art under ſuch a dumb conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? We read that Chriſt, in great wrath ſaid to his Diſciples, concerning the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the blind,</hi> let them alone, ſay nothing to them. Hath Chriſt ſaid thus to conſcience, concerning thee? Let him alone, ſay not a word to him, let him be blind while he will, let him be hardned while he will, ſpeak no more to him to awaken him? Is not this a dreadful caſe?</p>
            <p>O Friends, pray for a faithful conſcience, that will not ceaſe to warn you from day to day. Do not muzzle the mouth of conſcience, encourage your conſciences to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48705:48"/>
ſpeak to you, by giving them free leave to ſpeak; yea, by asking and enquiring of conſcience, Conſcience what ſayeſt thou to this courſe I am going on in? If I ask my will or my affections, or my luſts concerning theſe vain ways, theſe all are pleaſed, and like it that I go on thus: But what ſayeſt thou, O my conſcience? Is it good that I be a Worldling, or a Senſualiſt, or a Liar, or unjuſt or unmerciful? Is this as God would have it? Is this the life that God is well pleaſed with? Ask conſcience ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and put conſcience to it, to give in its anſwer, and there is hope it will ſpeak: And then hear what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeaks. If conſcience ſpeak and ſpeak, and men will not hear, this is the next way to ſtop its mouth; a deaf ear will make a dumb conſcience. If conſcience ſpeaks and it cannot be heard, if the warnings and items of conſcience be born down by luſt and appetite, this is the next way to put conſcience to ſilence, that it ſpeaks no more.</p>
            <p>Sinners, you have been hitherto conſulting with fleſh and bloud, taking counſel of ſenſe and appetite, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt; and whileſt conſcience hath kept ſilence, you ſee in what away you have gone on. Would you have conſcience ſpeak, or have it hold its peace? Will you henceforth enquire of conſcience, what it does in earneſt judge of your preſent life? what it does judge beſt for you from henceforth to do? Will you hear conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when it ſpeaks? Will you be guided and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by conſcience? I will not henceforth pleaſe my ſelf, but will endeavour to pleaſe God and conſcience, to live a conſciencious life: that is the beſt way to recover thy conſcience, to recover its ſpeech. Thy conſcience is ready to die, if it become ſpeechleſs. When ſick men are come to be ſpeechleſs, we count them dying. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of thine that hath ſo long lien ſpeechleſs, it will die if thou take not ſome ſudden courſe to recover its ſpeech. O get you a ſtirring lively conſcience that will not hold its peace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A Scepter.</hi> Conſcience is to be the Governour in the ſoul; God hath ſaid to Conſcience as he ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. <hi>Be thou ruler in the midſt of thine enemies.</hi> Thou liveſt in the midſt of enemies; all within, the carnal mind, the carnal will, the carnal affections, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very luſt of the heart, theſe are all enemies to conſcience;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48705:48"/>
but yet God ſays to it, conſcience be thou ruler in the midſt of thine enemies. Thoſe that are under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God he puts them all under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conſcience; as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he came for a bleſſing after <hi>Jacob</hi> had been bleſſed before him, I have, ſays he, made him thy Lord, and thou ſhalt be his ſervant; though thou ſhalt break his yoke from off thy neck. So God ſays to the heart and all within it, I have made conſcience your Lord, you will break its yoke from off your necks, you will all conſpire to rebel and to reſiſt conſcience, to blind, and to muzzle, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy conſcience, [Luſt is Conſciences deadly enemy] but yet I have ſaid to conſcience, be thou ruler in the midſt of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e enemies.</p>
            <p>All the World are governed by God or the Devil, and both theſe Governours have their Viceroys; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the Viceroy of God, and Luſt is the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of the Devil. Now theſe two Viceroys contend who ſhall have the dominion, who ſhall have the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the ſoul. Luſt cannot endure that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould bear any ſway. Carnal earthly minded men will rather mock at conſcience than be governed by it. Luſt will not endure that Conſcience ſhould bear the ſway, and Conſcience can never be ſafe or ſucceſsful in its government, till luſt be trodden under foot.</p>
            <p>Whileſt Conſcience is kept as an underling, and is checked and controlled and put to ſilence by Luſt, ſo long it is in an evil caſe. Conſcience is never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, till it hath recovered its authority and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>God that hath given the dominion to Conſcience, and under Chriſt, laid the government upon its ſhoulder, hath alſo put a <hi>Scepter</hi> into its hand, to execute its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment withal; and hath given to Conſcience a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Scepter:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>An Iron Scepter,</hi> and he hath ſaid to it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners, obſtinate ſinners, as he ſaid concerning his enemies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt rule them with a rod of iron.</hi> This iron Scepter put into the hand of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hath teeth in it; hence do ſinners, who will not hear the commands, ſometimes feel the bitings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48705:49"/>
and the teeth of a provoked Conſcience will bite worſe than the teeth of a Lion or a Bear. Thou that rebelleſt againſt Conſcience, that abuſeſt and wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Conſcience, take heed of the bitings of Conſcience; thy conſcience is a Lion, and though now it be a ſleeping Lion, and thou dareſt play with it, or uſe it at thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet look to it, when this ſleeping conſcience is awakened, then thou wilt feel the teeth of this Lion. As it is ſaid of Wine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.32. <hi>In the end it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder.</hi> So it is true of every ſin, every ſin will bite: thoſe carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, thoſe worldly gains that look upon you with a pleaſant fawning face, all your ſins and ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will bite, bite like a Serpent, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> poiſonous deadly biting; ſin will thus bite, and ſin bites with the teeth of Conſcience. O the gripes that ſome ſinners feel, the deadly gripes, when they fall under the teeth or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of a ſin-provoked Conſcience. Sinners I warn you to take heed of ever ſlighting Conſcience again. Come under the dominion of Conſcience, let Conſcience go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern thee, let Conſcience rule thee, or look for the Iron Scepter to fall upon thee, the teeth whereof will bite thee as a Serpent and ſting thee as an Adder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Golden Scepter.</hi> Conſcience doth not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force its authority, and our ſubmiſſion to it, by the terrors of its iron Scepter, but encourages ſubmiſſion, by the comfort of holding to us its Golden Scepter. King <hi>Ah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48705:49"/>
and unfaithfulneſs, God will condemn us; but if our hearts condemn us not, if conſcience acquit us, and ſay to us, well done good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful; if our upright conſciences acquit us, then have we confidence and boldneſs before God. The comfort and the rejoicing that flows into the heart from the teſtimony of a good conſcience, ſee in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p>Friends, how would you have your Conſcience to deal with you? Would you that it hold out the golden Scepter? Would you that Conſcience ſpeak peace, that Conſcience ſhould ſay, well done, thou haſt been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, would you have this teſtimony from conſcience, that you have had your converſation in ſimplicity and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincerity? Is the peace of conſcience, the joy of that peace, the ſweetneſs, and calmneſs, and ſerenity of heart, which is the fruits of conſciences ſpeaking peace, Is this peace, is this rejoicing of any value with you? Whileſt others are under the checks and rebukes, under the terrours; and the ſting of an abuſed conſcience, whileſt conſcience bites them and worries them, with the teeth of its iron Scepter, whileſt conſcience affrights and terrifies them, whileſt conſcience judges them, and condemns them for their following their luſts; whileſt it is ſo dreadful with men of an abuſed griping conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if you would prize and deſire, and rejoice in the peace and the comforts of conſcience, then hearken to conſcience, and be governed by conſcience in all your ways. And if conſcience may but govern you, it will certainly comfort you.</p>
            <p>Therefore, 3. <hi>Live under the government of conſcience:</hi> that is, live a conſcientious life, make conſcience of your duties, and perform them, make conſcience of ſin, and avoid it. Approve your hearts to your conſciences in all things; be conſcientious livers, and be univerſally conſciencious. Be able to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. <hi>I have lived in [all] good conſcience:</hi> and as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. <hi>I have a good conſcience willing in all things to live honeſtly.</hi> To obey conſcience in ſome things, and to rebel againſt it in other things, is not to live a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious life; be univerſally conſcientious of every duty, of every ſin.</p>
            <p>O Friends, how many are there of us even among
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48705:50"/>
Profeſſors, that do halt after conſcience, are very lame and deceitful in our ways; ſome things we do, and other things we neglect; ſome ſins we forbear, and other ſins we venture upon.</p>
            <p>You that are Profeſſours, and ſeem in a fair way of recovery, conſider how you come off here, it may be, you are afraid of groſs ſins, you dare not be drunk, or ſwear, and curſe, and blaſpheme, but are you afraid alſo of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the name of God in vain? Mingling <hi>O Lord, O God, O Chriſt,</hi> with your common and ordinary diſcourſes? It may be you are afraid to be found in an alehouſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and partakers with the drunken, and the riotous but are you afraid to be found unneceſſarily among the vain ones, and to become vain with thoſe that are vain? It may be you are afraid to couzen and cheat, your conſciences will not ſuffer you to do that, but yet do you not covet, or be inordinatly eager and greedy after the world? It may be you dare not work, or travel on the Lords day (though ſome among us will venture to do that alſo, the conveniences for their markets or their fairs, and the ſhortning their expenſes, what ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſayes to the contrary, will put them upon this Sabbath profanation.) One word by the way to ſuch; I remember a ſtory told me by a reverend man that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of his flock, being about to travel upon the Lords day to a Fair that was next day, being reproved of it by his miniſter, and asked if he thought it not a ſin, yes I do ſays he, but I have repented of it. His meaning was, he meant to travel the next Lords day, but he had repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it already.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange kind of repentance, for a man that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an alehouſe or to a whore, firſt to do ſomething that he could call repenting and then to go and commit the fact. You that are guilty (if there be any ſuch among you) let me ask you, have you repented of your former Sabbath profanations, or have you not? If you have not repented, there is the guilt of all your former journies of this kind ſtill lying upon you, you are guilty to this day, guilt is never taken away without repentance.</p>
            <p>If you ſay you have repented of your former practice, then I hope you mean, never while you live to be guilty again. You have not repented of any ſin, till you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved through the grace of God, to forſake it for ever.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48705:50"/>
Remember this unleſs you reſolve to have done with all ſuch journeyings hereafter, you have not repented of what is paſt, and if you have not repented of what is paſt, there is the guilt of all ſtill lying upon you, and your ſouls lyable to anſwer for it before the Judgment of God.</p>
            <p>But thou that alloweſt not thy ſelf ſuch a liberty of working, or journying upon the Lords day, yet doſt thou make conſcience of ſleeping, or loitering, or idling out a great part of the day? It may be thou wilt not be then found in the fields, or at thy ſports, for conſcience ſake, but maiſt thou not be found walking about the ſtreets, or idly viſiting, or vainly ſpending thy time with a neighbour? Though thou wilt not be abroad when thou ſhouldſt be in the Congregation, yet wilt thou not be out of doors when thou ſhouldſt be teaching, or inſtructing, or praying with thy family? It hath often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to think how little help ſome poor families have from their governours, even on the day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>It may be you will not be unjuſt or deceitful in your dealings, but are you not unmerciful or uncharitable? It may be you bear no rooted malice or grudge in your hearts, God forbid you ſhould, that is for a Devil, rather than a Chriſtian, but ſuppoſe you do not, yet it may be you do; What ever you think you may have routed malice from reſting in your hearts; But if you do not, yet you will be fretful and furious, and ſoure, and ſullen, and can expreſs it in bitter looks, in ſtrangeneſs and keeping your diſtance, in biting words, and backbiting ſtories, and this conſcience lets you alone in.</p>
            <p>It may be you are not of a vicious converſation, but are you of a gracious converſation? It may be there may be no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouths, your breath doth not ſtink of ribaldry, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene diſcourſes, but yet are you not frothy and unſavory in your communication If your ſpeech be not rotten and corrupt, yet is it <hi>ſeaſoned with ſalt,</hi> that it may <hi>adminiſter grace to the hearers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be you dare not neglect praying, but yet will not your conſciences ſuffer you to trifle and ſhuffle in prayer? It may be you pray and are ſerious in prayer, and feel ſome workings of conſcience, and meltings of heart, and enlargement of affection, and ſome ſenſe of God and religion, whilſt you are upon your knees but
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48705:51"/>
when you have done, and go out of your cloſet, do you not then leave your conſciences behind you, your religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you? Do you carry conſcience into your ſhops, &amp; into your fields, &amp; unto the markets? You pray as a man of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and hear as a man of conſcience, but do you buy &amp; ſell, eat and drink, and converſe in the world as a man of conſcience. Take you out of duties, and may we not take you out of your religion? What are you at other times, but even as other men? Is this to be univerſally conſcientious? Can you be ſincerely conſcientious, if you be not univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo? He that is not conſcientious in every thing, is truly conſciencious in nothing. Brethren take heed you do not give conſcience <hi>a kiſs and a kick.</hi> Kiſs it, and comply with it, in the things you like, and kick at conſcience when it preſſes too hard upon you in the things you like not. If in any thing you give conſcience a <hi>kick,</hi> conſcience may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you and give you a <hi>gripe</hi> for it another day.</p>
            <p>O if you would recover the authority of conſcience, if you would have conſcience hold out the golden Scepter to you, if you would have conſcience ſmile upon you, if you would have true peace of conſcience, and live in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed under the power of conſcience, be univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious; exerciſe your ſelves to it, to live holily in all things, honeſtly in all things, and at all times. This exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of keeping to conſcience is a painful exerciſe, you can never live a conſcientious life, unleſs you will be content to live a painful life, to take pains with your hearts, to take pains with your thoughts and affections, to take pains with your tongues and all your members, to hold them cloſe to the rule of conſcience: this painful exerciſe will get you an heat, will beget warmth in thoſe cold and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hearts. The moſt conſcientious Chriſtians are the moſt warm and lively Chriſtians, and according as you get and keep your hearts warm, ſo will your diſeaſes waſte, &amp; the health of your ſouls return into you. Remember what I have ſaid, if ever you would recover your loſt ſouls, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſcience; if ever you would recover conſcience, get the guilt &amp; the guile of conſcience purged away by the bloud of Chriſt, and water of repentance; keep the eye of conſcience open, let conſcience be the Superviſor of all your ways; let the book of conſcience be kept clear from blots and blurs, and let there be a faithful record kept there, of all your ways; let the tongue of Conſcience
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48705:51"/>
have leave to ſpeak and warn you from day to day, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to its Scepter and government; be no longer govern'd by Will or by appetite, or by luſt, or by the faſhions and cuſtoms or examples of men, but be govern'd by Conſcience. Do not give Conſcience a Kiſs and a Stab, hearken to it in ſome things and wound it in other things, but ſtudy to live in <hi>(all)</hi> good Conſcience; on your Sabbath-dayes, on your working-dayes, in the Houſe of the Lord, in your own houſes, in the houſes of your Friends, in the Field, in the Market, in the matters of God, in the matters of the World, when you are alone, when in company, when you are in good company, when you are fallen into evil company, wherever you are, whatever you are a doing, ſtill have an eye upon Conſcience, an ear open to Conſcience, and let Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience preſcribe to you, what you ſhould do, and how you ſhould carry it in every affair.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Beware of taking cold.</hi> That's a ſpecial rule Phyſicians uſe to give to the recovering Patient; when Perſons are upon recovery of their bodily diſeaſes, how ordinary is it, that upon a little cold, they relapſe, and ſometimes die of their diſeaſe. Is thy Soul upon recovery? take heed of Colds. Soul, ſuch there are, who when they begin to be wrought upon, and brought to any ſence of Religion, there appears a great heat and fervour of ſpirit upon them; 'tis with them as with the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Thy Word was in me like fire;</hi> their love and deſire, and zeal for God ſeem all in a flame: O what warm affections have they! how warm in their Duties! how warm in their converſes! they ſeem to be all Life and Soul; and then after a time they grow ſtark cold, and little life is left in them, and ſome of them never recover again while they live. Hath thy Spirit gotten an heat? hath the Word heated thee, and thoſe Exerciſes of Prayer, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and keeping Conſcience, gotten thee into an heat? then take heed of growing cold; keep you conſtant to thoſe Exerciſes that have begotten an heat in you. Keep you in the Sun-ſhine, all your heart-warmth is begotten, and muſt be maintained from above; live in the beholding the face of God, live under the Sun-beams of the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; keep you cloſe to God, keep you near to Chriſt, live in intimate communion with God. Take heed of thoſe clouds, your ſins, that will obſcure the Sun. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1. Take heed of an Eclipſe, ſee that this Earth do not interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your Souls and Heaven; take heed of the damp Influences

of the dead that you live amongſt. We live in a cold World, a cold Age: that Age has overtaken us, which Chriſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.20. <hi>Wherein the love many of ſhould wax cold.</hi> Thoſe that are grown cold themſelves, will ſerve for nothing, but to chill, and damp the Spirits of others. Be not unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily converſant with this cold World, truſt not your ſelves in their Company; have you never found, how much your Souls have loſt by carnal Correſpondencies? Profeſſors, how is it with you? Do you ſtill retain your firſt, vigour, as when you began to be recovered? May not the Lord complain over ſome of us, as of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 2.2. <hi>I remember the kindneſs of thy Youth, and the love of thine Eſpouſals;</hi> I remember it as a thing that is paſt, that now is not, or as <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2.4. <hi>Thou haſt loſt thy firſt Love;</hi> and what follows from this decay? Hence is it that we are become a Company of ſickly Profeſſors, of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſors, of Earthly Profeſſors; the World hath return'd upon us, the Fleſh hath gotten head again in us; the things that are Eternal, and the influences of them upon us, are even loſt and ſwallow'd up of things Temporal; our Stocks, and our Buſineſſes, and our Trades, how have they even choak'd up our Religion?</p>
            <p>Friends, it's matter of aſtoniſhment to conſider, how very few lively Chriſtians there are to be found amongſt us. Thus we every one talk, what a General decay of Religion there is among us; has not thine own Mouth complain'd of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Age? But whilſt thou complaineſt of the Age, how is it with thee? Art not thou ſick of the ſame Diſeaſe? Look homeward, look inward into thine own Houſe, into thine own Heart, what Spirit of Religion is there going in thine own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Haſt thou not by thy negligence, let all run to decay there? What Life of Religion is there maintain'd in thine own Heart? Friends, feel you every man his own Pulſe, lay your hand every Man upon his own Heart, and feel how faintly it beats Heaven-wards. Sure Friends, if we ſhould examine our own Caſes, we ſhould find enough to ſet us all a Weeping over our own decays, and ſhe ſhould hear that voice within us, <hi>Weep not for others, but weep for thy ſelf and thine own Children.</hi> O take heed, leſt ſuch of you as are fallen back among the Sick, do not alſo return among the Dead, and make your recovery again more hopeleſs at laſt than 'twas at firſt. You that ſtand, be warn'd by thoſe that are fallen; ſtand with your Loyns girded, and your Lights burning; and you that are fallen, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to decay, fallen to a dead and flat and lifeleſs State, you that

are fallen, remember whence you are fallen; remember and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, remember and recover, <hi>ſtrengthen the things that remain;</hi> if there be any ſparks left, blow off your Aſhes, blow up the Coals. Let the Life of God, and the love of Chriſt, and a Zeal for Holineſs, be again kindled in you; and if ever the Lord ſhould recover you again, (there's great hazard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may, thou mayeſt die of the Cold thou haſt taken, the Conſumption that hath Eaten up ſo much of thy Vitals, may be unto Death, Eternal Death) but if ever God ſhould recover thee again, and revive his work, and enliven that almoſt Dead Carkaſs; then at laſt learn from thine own miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience, to take heed of taking Cold again, as long as thou liveſt.</p>

            <p>The Heart thus recovered out of its loſt State, muſt be kept and well look'd to, that it fall not back again; and here,</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a wicked miſchievous heart,</hi> Jer. 17.9. <hi>Deſperately wicked,</hi> Pſalm 5.9. <hi>Very wickedneſs,</hi> Rom. 8.7. <hi>Enmity againſt God.</hi> It is the Fountain, whence all the filthy ſtreams, that pollute and defile our lives, do flow and are caſt forth.

Chriſtians, you may thank God, that there is Salt caſt into theſe filthy Fountains, for the healing theſe muddy waters; that there is a Spring of Living Waters broken in your Hearts, by degrees to drain out your Dirt, that there is Grace begotten in you, to reſiſt and repell the contagion of Luſt; but this little Grace will be choak'd up again, if Luſt be not kept under.</p>
            <p>And as it is a Wicked, ſo 'tis a Miſchievous Heart, it's ſet upon miſchief; Wickedneſs will be doing wickedly; as 'tis ſaid of the Workers of Iniquity, ſo 'tis true of all as far forth as they are unrenewed; <hi>Miſchief is in their Hearts,</hi> Pſal. 28.3. There's the ſame Reaſon of keeping our Hearts under reſtraint, as of keeping Mad-men in; they will be doing miſchief if they have their liberty. Beſides the miſchief that our evil Hearts will be doing to others, they will be miſchiefing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Mad Men will tear their own Fleſh, will cut and wound themſelves, if they be let alone; and there is no ſuch danger of evil Hearts, as in regard of that miſchief they do themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Our evil Hearts will hinder us from doing good to our Selves, or of receiving or laying up good for our Selves,</hi> Rom. 7.19. <hi>The good that I would, I do not;</hi> why what hinders? See Verſ. 21. <hi>I find a Law,</hi> the Law of Sin in the Heart, <hi>When I would do good, evil is preſent with me,</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit—ſo that we cannot do the things that we would.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times good Counſel is given us from the Lord, but we do not take it. How many good Counſels have you heard from the Miniſtry of the Word, that are loſt and forgotten and come to nothing. Sometimes a good motion comes into the Heart, to repent and amend our ways; to pray or to Meditate, or to ſearch out Hearts; to ceaſe from this Earth and Fleſh, from ſerving our Senſe, and minding only the preſent, and to lay up Treaſure in Heaven, and provide for the time to come; have you never ſuch motions? Do you never hear ſuch a

voice within you, Get you Baggs that wax not Old, a Treaſure in Heaven that faileth not? Chooſe the good part, lay hold on Eternal Life, give your ſelf to Praying, keep a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs, uſe more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, live with more heedfulneſs, have your Converſation in Heaven, and keep your ſelf unſpotted of the World, keep your ſelf in the love of God, ſet the Lord alway before your Eyes, behold his Face in Righteouſneſs, ſtudy to ſhew thy ſelf approved of God, and to walk ſo in all things, that thou mayeſt be accepted of God; are there not ſuch motions as theſe, come into your hearts? You that are Chriſtians, ſure you have many ſuch good motions; But how do they take? What do they bring forth? If you had obeyed all the good motions that you have ſometimes felt within you, O what manner of Chriſtians would you have been! What mortified, what circumſpect, what raiſed and Heavenly minded Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had you been? But how do your good motions take; What ſucceſs are they attended with? Do not you ſee, that they are often ſtrangled in the Birth, and die away and come to juſt nothing? Or at leaſt do you not meerly halt and trifle in the purſuace of them? If you Pray, or hear, or ſet your Hearts to humble your ſelves before the Lord; how are you Diſtracted, and Diverted, and Deadned and all your duties ſpoiled in the doing; ſo that you can have little comfort, or real advantage by what yo do. Do you not often mourn over your Prayers, and Sermons, and Sabbaths, as meerly loſt to you? When you would work up your Hearts Heaven ward, and fix above, when you would love and del ght your ſelves in the Lord, and Solace your ſelves in the contemplation of the Divine Love and Goodneſs, when you would fain ſet your Hearts to live ſuch a Godly, Conſcientious, Circumſpect, Self-denying Life, and comfort your ſelves with ſuch thoughts; I hope I ſhall never live ſuch a Careleſs, Carnal, Uſeleſs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory, Earthly Life again; I hope you have many ſuch Thoughts, Deſires, Hopes, and Aims, you are lamentable Chriſtians if you have not, but how do they ſucced? What do they bring forth? Do they not often prove Abortive and bring forth nothing? May it not be ſaid of you as of thoſe, <hi>Job</hi> 15.35. <hi>They conceive miſchief, and bring forth vanity, or a lie.</hi> May it not be ſaid of you, I have conceived Truth, conceived good, I have had many hopeful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and yet at laſt I bring forth a lie, I am utterly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O this is your evil hearts that hinder you; when you would do good, evil is preſent with you, ſo that you cannot do the good that you would; 'tis that evil Law in your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, that evil heart that does you all this miſchief, that ſpoils all your Prayers, that diſtracts all your holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that breaks all your holy Purpoſes, that defeats and fruſtrates all your good deſigns for a more holy and fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſider theſe two ſorts of miſchiefs mens hearts do them, their heart hinders them from what's good, and tempts and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them away after that which is evil, and then you will underſtand what a neceſſity there is, that ſuch miſchievous hearts ſhould be carefully kept under government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is an unruly heart.</hi> It's ſaid concerning the Tongue, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.8. <hi>It is an unruly evil;</hi> but whence is the unrulineſs of the Tongue, but from the unrulineſs of the heart? 'Tis the heart that is the Lord of miſrule, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32. <hi>He that ruleth his own Spirit is better than he that taketh a City.</hi> There's need of more Wiſdom, of more Watchfulneſs, of more care and skill, to rule the heart, than to rule a whole City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

Conſider your ſelves in your praying, or hearing, or any of the moſt ſerious and important Exerciſes of Religion; your thoughts then, moſt eſpecially ſhould be compoſed and fixed; ſhould be fix'd upon God, ſhould be all giving their attendance upon the work of God. Thoſe moſt weighty things, the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48705:55"/>
eternal things that you are dealing about, ſhould take up all your thoughts. But how do we find it at ſuch times? what diſtractions, and wandrings, and runnings off of our thoughts do we then find? We can't hold our ſelves in, to think what we pray for, to attend on what we hear; and this is the great reaſon of the deadneſs of heart in Prayer, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficacy and unfruitfulneſs of our hearing; we that preach to you, ſhould have more hope of Succeſs upon you, if we could but fix your hearts, and get you to think more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently on what we ſpeak, but when the thoughts are gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we may to as good purpoſe ſpeak to Stones, as to Souls.</p>
            <p>How is it with you now? and how does it uſe to be with you, when you come to the Worſhip of God? where have your thoughts been, ſince you came here? how many things have you been thinking of, that you ſhould not? It may be thy thoughts have been at home all this while, or abroad in the Fields, upon thy Buſineſs, or upon thy Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or thou knoweſt not where. Who are there of us that do uſe to <hi>gird up the loyns of our minds,</hi> and to keep them cloſe to the work we are upon? and whether do your thoughts run at other times? how little room is there left for the thoughts of God, or of our Souls, or of the things Eternal, amongſt thoſe crowds and ſwarms of worldly thoughts, of wicked and vile thoughts, of vain and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent thoughts, which are ſtill thronging in upon us? Theſe evil thoughts are not only from the ſuggeſtion of the Devil, or from that variety of Objects that we have before us, from what we ſee, or hear, but are alſo the ſtreamings up of a corrupt heart; as out of a boyling Pot of filthy Liquor, or out of a reeking Dunghill, there ariſe ſtinking and noyſom ſteams, and ſmells, ſo naturally doth a corrupt heart ſteam up into the head, and fill it with vile thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and therefore the cure that is preſcribed for theſe evil thoughts is, the cleanſing of the heart from wickedneſs. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Get thine heart waſhed from its wickedneſs, and that's the beſt way to free thy ſelf of wicked thoughts. We have many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of vain thoughts, of diſturbing and diſtracting Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and we hear People asking often, How ſhall I be rid of theſe evil thoughts? Wo is me, what wandring, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, diſtracted Thoughts have I, ſo that I can never have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48705:55"/>
comfort in any thing I do! but man, conſider thou art under a worſe Diſeaſe, the unmortified Luſts of thine Heart, from whence theſe Thoughts ariſe.</p>
            <p>Canſt thou bear the Luſts of thine Heart? the Pride and frowardneſs and worldlineſs of thy Heart? canſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of thy Thoughts, and not complain of thy Luſts? One unmortified Luſt hath more miſchief in it than an hundred evil Thoughts. Thy Duty is to complain more of thy naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Heart, thy naughty diſpoſition and inclination, and to get theſe to be changed, and that's the beſt way to cure thee of evil Thoughts. I ſay, this is the beſt cure, get you better Hearts, waſh your Hearts from thoſe evil Luſts that dwell in them; If you would get rid of worldly Thoughts, purge out worldly Luſts; if you would be rid of Proud Thoughts, get the Pride of your Hearts ſlain, get you an humble Heart, and that's the beſt cure of proud imaginations; if you would be free from vain Thoughts, light and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and uſeleſs Thoughts, get you cured of the Vanity of your Spirits, get you to be ſerious, get an Heart more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon ſerious things, and that will diſcharge you of ſuch runagate and vagabond Thoughts. It is ſeldom that People complain of diſtracting or vain Thoughts, but there is a worſe Diſeaſe whence they ariſe, that they take no notice of: Thou haſt a vain trifling Heart, thou art not in good earneſt in thy Religion, thou art not ſenſible of the weight and importance of thine everlaſting concerns; thou haſt an unmortified Heart, unmortified Luſts in thine Heart, thou loveſt the World, and loveſt thy pleaſures, and luſteſt after thine eaſe or thy carnal delights, thine Heart ſits too looſe from God and the things of God; thou art not powerfully and reſolvedly bent for the Bleſſedneſs to come; thine Heart is not yet fixed upon Chriſt and Chriſtianity; this is a worſe Diſeaſe than evil Thoughts, though that be bad enough and the very root from whence they ariſe. Do not therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire barely, how ſhall I be freed from evil Thoughts? but chiefly, how may I get my Luſts ſubdued? how may I purge out thoſe evil Diſpoſitions and Deſires, how may I get my Heart more intently fixed on God, and things above? Get that done once, and thy evil Thoughts will quickly fall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the Paſſions of our Hearts;</hi> we have unruly Thoughts and unruly paſſions; there is an unrulineſs in all our Affections; who can love, and fear, and deſire, and grieve for nothing but what he ſhould, what he ſhould fear and deſire. What
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48705:56"/>
we ſhould not fear, we fear, and what we ſhould fear, we cannot: What we ſhould love, we cannot, and what we ſhould not love we ſet our Hearts upon. We cannot raiſe up good deſires in our Hearts, nor keep down evil; there is an unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in all our affections, but eſpecially the paſſion of Anger and Wrath, when this breaks forth, what Rude and brutiſh and wild Creatures do men become? like a roaring Lion, or a ranging Bear, like a Bear robbed of her Whelps, ſuch is a man in his rage to thoſe that ſtand in his way: The breaking forth of rage, is as the breaking forth of fire in an Houſe, how much water muſt there be to quench it? this unrulineſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the whole World abounds with proofs of; every Countrey, every City, nay, but few Families are there, whom their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences do not teach them, what an unruly thing the rage of the Heart of man is.</p>
            <p>And is there not a neceſſity of keeping ſuch an Heart under Government? of governing the Thoughts, and governing the Paſſions and unruly Affections? the neceſſity of Government upon the accompt of the unrulineſs of our Thoughts and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will appear if we conſider; that our Eternal State is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in our Thoughts and Paſſions.

or fear, becauſe they will not think; think more of God, think oftner, what 'tis to be Saved, what 'tis to be Damned, think much thus, and this will ſtir up your deſires and fears; deſire more the Salvation of God, fear more his indignation and Wrath, and this will ſet you to work out your Salvation, and to ſecure your ſelves from falling into Condemnation.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>good Thoughts</hi> and well order'd Affections, will ſet us a working out our Salvation, ſo by evil Thoughts, and unruly Affections men work out their Damnation. Unruly Thoughts, diſorderly affections in the Soul, are as croſs Winds, or as Storms or Tempeſts upon the Sea. How can the Mariner ever get to the Haven, when the wind is contrary? and what kindneſs do Tempeſts do him, but to daſh him againſt the Rocks, and drown him in the Deep? ungoverned Thoughts and Paſſions in the Heart are like Mutineers in an Army; what would an Enemy deſire more than to have the Army he was to fight againſt, to be in a Mutiny amongſt themſelves? the Devil will not doubt his Conqueſt, whilſt he can but keep all within you in diſorder. Mens Damnation does frequently begin in Thoughts; evil Thoughts corrupt the Affections, evil Affections corrupt the Manners and practice, and evil works have their end in Deſtruction. Never again make a light thing of Thoughts; how many men are there, who by giving themſelves leave to be thinking of their Pleaſures, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Gains, and thinking of their Laſcivious, luſtful Objects, do think themſelves into very Beaſts firſt, and then into Devils? <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. <hi>I made a Covenant with mine eyes, why then ſhould I think upon a Maid?</hi> The next to looking is think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the eyes let in Fuel for the Thoughts; the next to think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is luſting, the Thoughts provide Fuel for Luſt; the next to Luſting is Whoring, and the next to Whoring is Death; and the like in other Caſes: For the World, the next to thinking is loving, the next to loving is luſting, and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſiring; the next to luſting is ſeeking and progging; the next to ſeeking is getting and heaping up, and loading our ſelves with thick Clay; and the next to this is ſinking and drowning our ſelves in Perdition and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe are the Evidences of what we are, in reſpect to our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal State.</hi> Men may judge themſelves, and come to know themſelves, by the Thoughts and Affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>To be carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace. Thoſe that are after the Fleſh do mind the things of the Fleſh, and thoſe that are after the Spirit do mind the

things of the Spirit.</hi> Where art thou Friend? art thou in the way of Life, or the way of Death? why how may I tell that? why where are your minds? what are they running upon? where are your Thoughts, your moſt ſerious and delightful Thoughts? are they in Heaven or on Earth, on things Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or on things Carnal? where are your Affections? working upwards or downwards? Such as thy Thoughts and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, ſuch is the State of thy Soul: <hi>To be Carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace.</hi> It's true, many ſerious Chriſtians have too many Carnal Thoughts; Vain and Wandring Thoughts, but 'tis their Affliction, and 'tis their care and endeavour to give check to ſuch Thoughts; but when the allowed Stream runs towards Earth and ſin, 'tis a ſign thou art an Earthly Fleſhly Man, and in the State of the Dead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There are Idols ſet up in the Heart, after which, if it be not well looked to, it's apt to go a Whoring.</hi> It is true, more or leſs of all men, what is ſaid of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Theſe men have ſet up their Idols in their Heart.</hi> Whatſoever the Heart loves more than God, whatever the Heart ſerves or ſeeks more than God, yea, whatever the Heart loves or ſerves or ſeeks ultimately for it ſelf, without reſpect to any higher end, this is an Idol ſet up in the Heart; thoſe very men that abhor thoſe Idols that are ſet up in the Houſe or the Church, that deteſt Saint-Worſhip or Image-Worſhip, the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Stocks, or Stones, or Pictures, the work of mens hands, yea that call that an Idol or Idolatry, which God never called ſo, that cry out <hi>Idolatry, Idolatry,</hi> againſt every thing that is not according to their own Minds, even theſe very men, may have ſet up their Idols in their Hearts. The Heart hath multitudes of Idols ſet up in it; there are in the Heart as the Apoſtle ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. there are in the world, <hi>Gods many, and Lords many.</hi> The World is an Idol; ſome men make their Lands and their Money their Gods; though <hi>Job</hi> would not, <hi>chap.</hi> 31.24. yet ſome mens Hearts will ſay to their Gold, Thou art my God.

great Idol is <hi>Self,</hi> which is ſet up in the room of God.</p>
            <p>Mans original Apoſtacy was his falling from God to Self; and mans recovery to Chriſt, is his bringing back from Self to God. Therefore he tells the World, that whoſo will come along with him, and be his diſciple, muſt <hi>deny himſelf, Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any man— Chriſt ſuffered that he might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. And that he cannot do unleſs he come back from Self; he departed from God when he declined to himſelf, and he muſt deny himſelf, that will return to the Lord. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> divide the whole world: The moſt are for Self, and there is not a man of all theſe for God; ſome few are for God, and every one of theſe have denyed and departed from Self.</p>
            <p>Mens recovery by Chriſt, is their returning from Self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; but this Recovery is but imperfect, this Self, (car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Self I mean) hath a Seat, higher or lower in the beſt hearts. There is a ſinful Selfiſhneſs, wherewith we ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main infected, and there is ſtill a danger, even after our recovery, of Apoſtacy to this Self again. The great Idoll ſet up in the heart is ſelf, and the great Idolatry or going a whoring after this Idol, the great heart Idolatry ſtands in theſe three things.</p>

Sinners, is not this true? how many times hath the Lord God preached to you, of the neceſſity of Regeneration, and your being born again, of the neceſſity of Sanctification, your being made his holy ones, pure and undefiled ones? How much hath he ſpoken, to convince you, that you are the Sons of death, and that your ways are the ways of death; that you can never ſee the Kingdom of God, but muſt undoubtedly periſh, and be deſtroyed for ever, without ſuch a great and effectual change as may bring you in amongſt his holy ones? How often hath this been preached? how plainly hath this been proved? and yet after all, how is it with you? why behold you have a conceit you ſhall do well enough, and get to Heaven at laſt; and upon this conceit you will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture your Souls: What do you herein but Idolize your own Underſtandings, and deny the God that is above? <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> is nothing with you, nor will perſwade you to any thing, if your own hearts do but tell you, <hi>'tis well enough already.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The great controverſie betwixt God and Self is, whoſe Will ſhall ſtand:</hi> God will have his Will, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.23. <hi>I have Sworn by my Self, the Word is gone forth of my Mouth, and ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that unto me every knee ſhall bow;</hi> In one way or other, firſt or laſt, I'le make them all to ſtoop. God will have his Will, but Self alſo will have its Will; what is ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wiſdom of the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. is true of the Will of the Fleſh; The Wiſdom of the Fleſh <hi>is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> the Will of the Fleſh is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed will be. What is the Will of God? <hi>This is the Will of God, even your Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.3. He hath ſaid, <hi>Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.16. This is the Will of God to ſinners, <hi>their Salvation.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. <hi>He will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> The reaſon why ſo many are damned, is not becauſe God will have them damned, but becauſe they will not be ſaved. Though they will the <hi>end,</hi> their Salvation, yet they will not the <hi>means,</hi> their Sanctification. This is the Will of God, in order to the Salvation of Sinners, their Humiliation, their Repentance, their Obedience to the Goſpel; but theſe Self-will'd Sinners will not be humbled, will not repent, though their lives lye
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48705:59"/>
upon it, they will not; though their Salvation lyes upon their Humiliation and Repentance, yet they will not be humbled, they will not repent. The Will of God is, that men <hi>ſet their affections on things above, not on Earth,</hi> Col. 3.2. The will of Sinners is, to ſet their affections on the earth, and not on things above. The Will of God to Sinners is, their ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Government, to his diſpoſal; but the Will of the Fleſh is, to be their own Lords, to be at their own diſpoſal. Sinners are for living as they will, for having what they will; they would be let alone to take their own courſe, to walk in the way of their own Hearts, and the ſight of their own eyes. Now this is the great controverſie between God and ſinners, whoſe Will ſhall carry it. But you'l ſay, How can man have a controverſie with God? how can the Will of man ſtand it out againſt the Will of God? So the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Who hath reſiſted his Will? Anſw.</hi> There is the Will of God concerning <hi>events or matters of Fact,</hi> and there is the Will of God concerning <hi>matters of Duty.</hi> As to the Will of God concerning Events, what God hath Decreed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be done, ſhall be done, thus there's no reſiſting his Will: But then there is the Will of God concerning matters of Duty; God wills that it ſhall be every mans Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Repent and be Sanctified, and be obedient to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and accordingly commands them. And though there can be no ſuch reſiſtance here, but what God Wills to be mens Duty, ſhall be their Duty, yet ſuch reſiſtance there is, that what God Wills to be mens Duty to do, they will not do.</p>
            <p>God governs the world, and orders every thing to come to paſs in the World, according to his Will; but then there is his <hi>natural and phyſical Government,</hi> which he carries on by his abſolute Power, and there is his <hi>moral Government,</hi> by Laws, his Governing men as rational Creatures, by Laws and by Rewards and Puniſhments. This is Gods governing Will, that men make uſe of their reaſons, that they conſider what 'tis that he requires, and what 'tis that he forbids; that to the drawing them to obedience, and the deterring them from diſobedience, they conſider and improve Gods arguments, the great and Eternal rewards of obedience, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and eternal penalties of diſobedience; and ſo to order their courſe, that they may attain thoſe bleſſed rewards, and eſcape thoſe eternal puniſhments: And here he does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an invincible neceſſity upon mens Wills, but leaves men
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48705:60"/>
to their choice; he commands them to obey, that is his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Will, but if they will diſobey, let them at their own peril; and this commanding Will of God is that which Self doth reſiſt; God wills and requires men to repent, but they will not repent; God requires men to be holy, but they will not be holy; God requires men to ſeek, and to work out their own Salvation, but they will not, but ſet to Damning their own Souls; God requires men to ſubmit, not only to his Precepts, but to his diſpoſal, whether to be rich or poor, whether to be in Honour or Contempt, whether to be in health or in ſickneſs, but they will do neither; they will be, as far as they are able, their own Lords and their own Carvers; they will obey themſelves, and will ſhift for themſelves; they will not be content it be with them as God will have it; God would have them in all Eſtates to be content, this they will not be, but would have every thing, and to their own minds, whatever the Will of God be.</p>

But if God may be Judge, if Reaſon and Conſcience may be Judge, theſe will tell thee, thy eaſe, and thy carnal liberty, and carnal Pleaſures are all naught for thee; they are like to be thy bane, and thy ruin, and everlaſting undoing; but yet theſe are the things that their Wills are for.</p>

            <p>This now is the great Controverſie betwixt God and Self; whoſe will ſhall ſtand. God will have his will, and Self would have it's will, and the Heart is ever apt to ſide with Self againſt God. Sinners, learn to underſtand your ſelves, by what hath been ſpoken. Art not thou this ſelf-will'd Creature? What is it that carries the great ſtroak in thy Life? What is it that thou contendeſt for, but to have thine own will? What is the Law or the Rule thou <hi>wouldſt live by,</hi> but thine own unruly Will? This would pleaſe the ſinful World, if every one might be left to live as he will; to do what he will, and to have what he will. What is the Rule that Sinners do <hi>actually live by,</hi> but their own wills? What is it that hath kept you from Chriſt, ſo many of you all this while? that hath kept you from Repentance? This is your own wilfulneſs; you have been perſwaded to Chriſt, but you will not come, you have been perſwaded back from your ſins, but ye will not come back; you have been inſtructed in the way of Life, but you will not learn; you have been taught and call'd upon to become New Men, to become ſerious Chriſtians, but you will not hearken; you have been preſſed to give your ſelves to Prayer, to ſtudying the Scriptures, to ſtudying your own Hearts, to the ordering your Converſations according to the Goſpel, but you will not yield unto it; you will walk after the fleſh, you will be proud, you will be covetous and Carnal livers, and thus you ſpend out your days.</p>
            <p>Sinners conſider, who is it fit ſhould have the Government of you? The will of God, or your own wills? What would be beſt for you in the end, to be ſubject to the Law of God or this Law of ſin? What is it that God would have with you? This is the will of God, your Salvation; he would have you to Heaven, he would that theſe poor Souls of yours, whom the Devil hath made Drudges to your Fleſh, and Slaves to his Luſt, and Sacrifices to his Malice; God would have you to be Veſſels of Honour, to bear his Image, to ſhine forth in his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48705:61"/>
Glory, to live in his likeneſs, and to rejoice in his everlaſting Joy. Man, this is that which God would have, that thou maieſt live in everlaſting Bleſſedneſs, he would have thee to Heaven, and he would have thee by an Holy Life to be fitted for that Bleſſed Life, to be made meet to be a partaker of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. Therefore 'tis that he commands you to Repent, therefore 'tis that he with ſo much importunity perſwades you to Chriſt, that he might waſh you with his Blood, and guide you by his Word, and ſanctifie you by his Spirit, and <hi>preſent you blameleſs and faultleſs before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Glory with exceeding Joy,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> 24. This is the will of God, that you ſhould be thus Governed and thus Ordered; that theſe Earthen Veſſels, theſe dirty Souls might be made Veſſels of Honour, and of his everlaſting praiſe.</p>
            <p>And what is it that your own wills are for; but to live ſo, that you may be fit for nothing, but to be Veſſels of contempt, to be Fuel for the everlaſting Fire? The Devil and your own Hearts are conſpired, ſo to ſully, and to black you with your ways, that you may be fit for no other place, but to live in the Smoak and the Fire of the everlaſting Furnace.</p>
            <p>Gods will is to bring you to that Inheritance which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Heaven; he would have you to have all the Hell you ſhall have on this ſide the Grave, and your Heaven in that Eternity which comes after: Your ſorrows all here, and your troubles here, and hereafter your reſt from them all; but your will is, to have your Heaven here, your good things here, your Mirth and your Pleaſure here, and ſo leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but your Hell for hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now which of theſe two wills, God's will, or your own will, is it the beſt for you to be Governed by? If you ſay, God's will is better for me to follow, than mine own will; 'twill end beſt, whatever it ſeems to be at preſent; then one would think you ſhould ſee ſo much Reaſon againſt this ſelf-will'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt this wilfulneſs, and hardneſs, and obſtinacy in your own ways, as to tremble to think of being left any longer under the Government of your own wills.</p>
            <p>Sinners, let me do you a kindneſs this day; let me break the Yoak of Bondage, the will of your Fleſh from off your Necks, and unhorſe your Riders; the Devil Rides your wills, and your will rides your Souls, come off from this drudgery.

I live; will you ſay the word once? God would have me be a Penitent, and through his grace a Penitent I will be. God would have me to be a Chriſtian, a ſincere Chriſtian, and through his help a Chriſtian I will be. God would have me to walk humbly, to live honeſtly, to live a blameleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious Heavenly Life, and O this is the Life that I will give my ſelf to. What if you ſhould ſay this word, and ſay it heartily? What if this word ſhould prevail to fetch you off from your Wilfulneſs, and the hardneſs of your hearts, and lay your Souls at the Feet, and under the Government of the Almighty? What if ſuch a change ſhould now be wrought upon you, that your hearts ſhould now be brought about from Will towards God; from Luſt to Conſcience, from this thy Carnal and Senſual and vain Life, to a Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Life? Would you not bleſs God for ſuch a change? Would you not ſay, This is an happy Day for me, a Bleſſed change the Lord hath wrought upon me? Then hearken to the word you have heard, and ſay the word once, <hi>I will be the Lords,</hi> and from henceforth he alone ſhall have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of me. You that will not, but will be ſelf-will'd ſtill, will be hardned in your way ſtill, go home and chew upon this thought, <hi>Whether will this wilful hardned Heart lead me at laſt?</hi>

When the Power of Grace hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Power of Nature, the Sinner ſhall yield and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up to God, and be heartily contented to be thenceforth under his Rule and Government.

I reſign to the Lord, I ſubſcribe to the Lord, I give the Hand to the Almighty, and put my Neck under his Yoke for ever; his I am, and him alone will I ſerve. This is Converſion, this breaking off from under the Dominion of your own wills, and reſigning up to the will of the Lord.</p>

are they often ſet upon their own wills? How heady and wilful are they in their way? What ſtiffneſs and tenaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is there of their own purpoſes? They will not be adviſed, nor perſwaded out of their courſe: though as to the main, they have reſigned themſelves up to the will of God; yet in many particular Caſes, either upon miſtakes in their Opinions, or being overſwayed by corruption, they are head-ſtrong in their way, and will not be turned back. When they come to themſelves, it is their ſhame and affliction it ſhould be ſo, yet too often ſo it is, that this ſelf-will'dneſs carries them on, even againſt Counſel and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>It's true, where this ſelf-will does carry the main ſtroak in the Life, where the ordinary courſe and way of the Life is Governed by will, there's no Converſion, but there's no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert but more or leſs does groan under the Uſurpation and Tyranny of this Self and Fleſh. You that are Chriſtians would never have liv'd as ſometimes you have done, would never have carried it as ſometimes you have, ſo much againſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Counſel, and the moſt ſerious advices, if Will had not had too much power over you. We ſhould be even all of us more conſiderate and deliberate in our goings, we ſhould be more eaſily intreated, and perſwaded back from running headlong on in ſome of thoſe wayes which coſt us ſorrow afterwards, if this ſelf-will'dneſs had not prevailed in us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Therefore there is a neceſſity, that the Heart be kept under Government.</hi> The Government of the Heart, is to the ſame end and of the ſame neceſſity, as the Government of a Kingdom. The Government of a Kingdom, is to be for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the good, and for the terrour and ſuppreſſion of the evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. And to the ſame end is the Government of the Heart; to foſter, and cheriſh, and maintain, and keep alive the good that is in it; and to cruſh, and keep under the evil that is in it. If ſelf-will hath an evil Root in the Heart, if this evil Root be apt to ſpring up, then is there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of governing the Heart, to keep it under.</p>
            <p>To the governing the Heart, is neceſſary a double inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>a Spur and a Curb;</hi> a Spur to the good that is in us, to quicken Grace, and keep it in action; a Curb to that which is evil in us, to curb and hold under corruption; theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Government, are <hi>the reward and puniſhment;</hi> the bleſſed reward will be a Spur to Grace, the puniſhment to come will be a Curb to Luſt and Fleſh; the eying theſe two great recompences of reward, Glory and Wrath, the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48705:63"/>
the ſenſe of that Life and Death upon the Heart, is a great part of our excerciſing this Government upon us: thy ſelf-will is ſuch an obſtinate Enemy, as nothing but Fire and Sword, the Fire of Divine Indignation, and the Sword of Divine vengeance, will conquer and ſubdue it. There muſt be Government, and there muſt be ſevere penalties kept in ſight, or there's no good to be done.</p>
            <p>Friends, If ever you would Conquer this ſelf-will'dneſs, ſhew it the Fire, the Racks, the Gridirons, the Gibbets, the everlaſting Priſon, that it's ruſhing and hurrying you upon.</p>
            <p>Self-will'dneſs is not only a kicking againſt the Pricks, but a running upon the Pikes of Divine Vengeance; thou art heady, and wilful in thy way, thou art ſet upon thine own will; whatever thou likeſt, and art pleaſed with, thou art ſo ſet upon it, that there's no perſwading thee back; but be adviſed, take heed: if thou wilt be wilful, at thy Peril be it; look before thee, to the precipice, by which this ſelf-will'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is tumbling thee headlong down into the Everlaſting Pit; whenever you feel <hi>Will</hi> begin to riſe, and work, work againſt Reaſon, work againſt Conſcience, work towards iniquity and vanity, when you feel this ſelf-will getting up, lay hold on the Bridle, put on the Curb, give check to it with all your might; look towards the land of Darkneſs, whither it's carrying thee; when the fit is up, the wilful fit (for though there be an abiding habit of wilfulneſs in the Heart, yet it comes forth but by fits) when the wilful fit is up, think, Lord what now? Whither is this wilful will driving me? What will be its Fruits and Wages? What end am I like to come to, if this be my way? Stop, Oh my wretched Heart, ſtrike ſail, Oh my obſtinate will, take Counſel, be well adviſed, and run not thus headlong upon thine own ruin.</p>
            <p>O hold up ſuch Government in your Spirits, that your Hearts may be tractable, and flexible, plyable Hearts; let them be ſtiff, and faſt to the concernments of God, but looſe and eaſily withdrawn from the intereſt of Self. Stiff againſt ſin, ſtiff againſt Temptation, reſolute for Holineſs. Is thy will brought about for God, for Religion, for Conſcience? Stand to it to the Death; never be perſwaded out of your Religion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be perſwaded out of your Conſciences, or Conſciencious walking; let your Hearts be reſolved for the greateſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion, and be ſtrict and ſtiff in ſuch Holy reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but never again be ſo ſet upon your own wills, your Carnal wills; here get a pliable Heart, never to be perſwaded
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48705:63"/>
off from God, eaſily to be perſwaded back from Self and Fleſh. It's Propheſied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6. There ſhall be ſuch a change wrought upon the rough and furious and ravenous Spirits of Sinners, by the power of Chriſt, that the Wolf and the Leopard and the Lyon ſhall be ſo tamed, <hi>that a little Child may lead them.</hi> They ſhall be ſo flexible and pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they may be eaſily lead; that the leaſt Items or Intimations from God, or from Conſcience, may bring them to any thing; that when Luſt puts hardeſt upon them for ſin, when Self preſſes moſt impetuouſly upon them for mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or purſuing it's Intereſt, or will, a Word from God, an Item from Conſcience, may bring them about after the Lord, that Self may never be able to fortifie them againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but that Conſcience may with eaſe break the Bands, and looſe the Cords of Self, and command them after their God. It was ſaid of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Souldiers, that where his Intereſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, they were more than Men, in their own concernments they were leſs than Women. Let the Servants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> learn ſo much of the Souldiers of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> let them be ſo true, ſo faſt to the Intereſt of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Religion, of Holineſs, that they may be above the Spirit of a Man; and ſo the Spirit of a Chriſtian is, above the Spirit of a Man; but let them ſit ſo looſe from the Intereſt or the Commands of Self, that a Woman, or a little Child may bring them back from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of it; that ſuch a word from whatever Mouth it comes, what is this Self or this Fleſh to thee, that thou ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſt to it, or inſiſteſt ſo upon it? Wilt thou obey thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary? Wilt thou cleave to thy Mortal Enemy? Self is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; 'tis the worſt Enemy thou haſt, and wilt thou feed thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Strengthen thine Enemy, Fight for thy Enemy? That ſuch a word may be enough to countermand the will of the Fleſh, and to bring the Heart back from obeying it's ſtrongeſt motions and Luſts. This will be the bleſſed Fruit of a due Heart-government the defeating and ſubduing of Self-will, and the ſweet and eaſie compliance of the Heart with, and it's complacency in the will of God; and it will be no hard thing for ſuch a Soul to ſay, Not my will, but the will of the Lord be done.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> the ſecuring our ſelves from Miſchief, the ſaving our ſelves from danger, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. <hi>Save your ſelves this generation.</hi> He that ſaid, <hi>Save your ſelves from this evil generation,</hi> hath therein ſaid much more; ſave your ſelves from Condemnation: To ſave our ſelves from ſin, to ſave our ſelves from Wrath, to ſave our Souls, this is a great Duty ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on every man in this World; and this Self-ſaving, or Self-preſervation, our Self-love will prompt and preſs us to. He that loveth himſelf will ſave himſelf, he that duly loveth his Soul, will do what he can to ſave his Soul. That men deſtroy and Damn themſelves, that men neglect Chriſt the Author of Salvation, that men neglect Religion and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, the way of Salvation, is for want of a true love to themſelves. Sinners, Chriſt is Preached unto you, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to you, and if you lov'd your ſelves better, you would love Chriſt and accept of him. You are exhorted to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to Godlineſs, and if you loved your own Souls, you would repent and be holy. Thou art an hater of thy Self, an Enemy, a Murderer of thine own Soul, who art not a lover of Chriſt, and of Religion and godlineſs. What a Brute art thou, O ſinner? yea, worſe than a Brute; thou canſt love thy Friends, thou canſt love thy Wife and thy Child, thou canſt love thy Companions, yea thou canſt love thy ſins and thy luſts, only thou haſt no love to thy Soul. 'Tis laid down as a mark of wicked Perſons, among many others, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Without natural Affection:</hi> For a Child to be without natural Affection to the Parents, for Parents to be without natural affection to the Child, for men to be ſtrangers to their own fleſh, without natural Affection to their Friends or Relations, this is a mark of a wicked man. What is it then for men to be without natural affection to their own Souls? wilt thou ſay thou loveſt thy Soul, when thou ſo ſadly neglecteſt thy Soul? when thou takeſt no care for thy Soul, when for the love of thy Luſts, and thy Pleaſures, and thy Companions, thou wilt Damn thy Soul?</p>
            <p>Sinners, what have you done for your Souls ever ſince you were born? You have done ſomething for your Fleſh; you have fed it, and cloathed it, and wrought hard for it, to get a proviſion and maintenance for it; but what have you done
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48705:64"/>
for your Souls? what pains didſt thou ever take that it might be well with thy Soul? what knowledge haſt thou gotten? what Grace haſt thou gotten? what Peace for thy Soul? haſt thou gotten Peace with God? haſt thou done any thing toward the reconciling thy Soul to God? thou knoweſt how little thou haſt done; thou haſt loaden ſin upon thy Soul, thou haſt loaded guilt upon thy Soul, thou haſt left it like the Soul of a <hi>Laodicean, Rev.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Poor, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Blind, and Naked;</hi> that Soul within thee is a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Soul, a guilty Soul, a blinded hardned Soul, a polluted naked Soul; it would make your hearts ake if you conſider'd it, in what woful wretched caſe you have left your Souls to this day. If you have ſo much ſenſe in you, think of it, and lay it ſadly to Heart, what a miſerable caſe you have left your Souls in; the reaſon of this is, becauſe you are without love to your Souls, hence is it that you have had ſo little care of your Self-preſervation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Self-bleſſing,</hi> Iſa. 65.16. There is a Self-bleſſing, that is our Duty; <hi>Let him that Bleſſeth himſelf in the Earth, bleſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the God of Truth:</hi> He that loveth himſelf will bleſs himſelf. There's a double Self-bleſſing. 1. <hi>A ſeeking our own bleſſedneſs.</hi> Self-love will prompt us to ſeek an happineſs for our ſelves; not only to ſave our ſelves from Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but to bring our ſelves to Bleſſedneſs. The bleſſedneſs which true Self-love wiſheth and ſeeketh for Self, is in God, in the God of Truth. He that truly loveth his own Soul, can be content with nothing leſs than God, for the bleſſedneſs of of it. No State, no Inheritance, no Treaſure can ſatisfie him below Heaven and everlaſting glory. There's not a man of you that loves his Soul, but he is ſeeking Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Immortality for it; he is taking care, and taking pains, to get a place in Heaven for his Soul, to lay up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven for it. Doſt thou love thy ſelf, who doſt not bleſs thy Self, or ſeek a Bleſſing in God for thy Self? Doſt thou bleſs thy Self in God, who ſlighteſt God, who careſt not for God, and who refuſeſt the bleſſing of God, and this for the ſake of thy Luſts and Pleaſures? Sinner, loveſt thou thy Self? loveſt thou thine own Soul? O ſeek a Bleſſing for it, a bleſſing in God, a bleſſing in Heaven for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>An enjoying and rejoycing in your own Bleſſedneſs:</hi> Loving our ſelves aright, is part of the fruition and enjoying our ſelves, as loving God is of the fruition of God. No man that loves himſelf, but he would enjoy himſelf, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48705:65"/>
bleſs himſelf in the reflection on his own Happineſs. And this is the ſelf-bleſſing mentioned, let him <hi>bleſs himſelf in the God of Truth;</hi> that is, let him ſatisfy himſelf, let him comfort himſelf, let him enjoy and rejoyce over himſelf upon this account, that the God of Truth is his God, and his Happneſs: Let him not bleſs himſelf in the Earth, that Riches are his, that Pleaſures and Honours are his, that he hath the World at will, but that the Lord God is his; let him not chear himſelf with the Rich Man's Song, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>Soul take thine eaſe,</hi> thou mayeſt enjoy thy Self, for <hi>thou haſt goods laid up for many Years;</hi> but let him take up the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Song, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. <hi>Return unto thy reſt O my Soul;</hi> herein thou mayeſt bleſs thy Self, herein thou mayeſt comfort thy Self, <hi>the Lord hath dealt graciouſly with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friends, you whoſe God is the Lord, you are the Men that may bleſs your Selves, you are the Men that may enjoy your Selves; you may look into your Hearts with comfort, you may look upon your States with Joy; you may bleſs your Selves that God hath given you ſuch an Heart; you may bleſs your Selves that God hath given you ſuch a Portion. You that have an Intereſt in God, and this witneſſed by the Image of God upon your Hearts, you may enjoy your Selves and take comfort, as often as you look inward, and ſee the Marks and the Prints of Divine Grace ſtamped upon you; your very love to your Selves will make you to rejoice over your Selves, as often as you view the bleſſed Frame into which the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Grace of God hath brought you: Well this Self-love with it's Fruits, <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> and <hi>Self-bleſſing,</hi> is our Duty; and the Lord hath planted it in our Hearts, on purpoſe to bring us on upon all our other Duties.</p>
            <p>God makes great uſe of this innocent Self-love, in his Government of the World. God Governs by Laws, and Laws Govern by their Rewards and Puniſhments, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments have their Efficacy by vertue of this love of our ſelves; what would Laws ſignifie, were there no Rewards to the Obedient, nor Penalties to the Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient? Theſe are the Sinews and Strength of Laws; and what would Rewards and Penalties ſignifie to us, were we not lovers of our Selves? Our Self-love prompts us to ſeek our good, and to prevent our miſery. As far as we love our Selves, we deſire our own Happineſs. 'Twas Self-love, that made thoſe many, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. to ſay, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> 'Twas the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Love to the Church,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48705:65"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.9. that made him ſay, <hi>I will ſeek thy good;</hi> and hence 'tis that we endeavour the prevention of our ruin; Self-preſervation is the Fruit of Self-love. Self-love is the firſt ſpring and motive to Religion; 'tis true, when we come to be Religious indeed, there are higher motives; the love of God, the Love of Chriſt is the great Argument to carry us on in ſound Religion, when we come to be Chriſtians, then the main Motive to Chriſtianity is, that which Chriſt uſed to <hi>Peter, John,</hi> 21.15. to faithfulneſs in his Miniſtry, <hi>Loveſt thou [me?] Feed my Sheep. Loveſt thou me? Feed my Lambs. If ye love me, keep my Commandments, Joh.</hi> 14.15. But the firſt Motive to bring us to be Chriſtians, is this Self-love. Loveſt thou thy Self? Then give thy Self to Chriſt. Loveſt thou thy Soul? Then be a Chriſtian. Chriſt is the only way to bleſſedneſs; <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.12. <hi>And he that not the Son, hath not Life.</hi> Chriſt is the only way to bleſſedneſs, and the only ſecurity againſt miſery, againſt Everlaſting miſery. <hi>There is no Condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no Name under Heaven, by which we muſt be ſaved;</hi> ſaved from Death, from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death, <hi>but by the Name of</hi> Jeſus, Acts 4.12. Now when Chriſt ſays, <hi>Come unto me, and ye ſhall have reſt,</hi> Mat. 11. <hi>Follow, me and ye ſhall have Treaſure in Heaven,</hi> Mark. 10. <hi>He that is aſhamed of me, of him will I be aſhamed before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is in Heaven;</hi> the intent and meaning of all this is, if you love your Selves, come to me; if you love your Souls, keep my Commandments; if ever you would, that thoſe Souls of yours ſhould be happy Souls, if you would not that they ſhould be Loſt, and Burned and Drowned in everlaſting Deſtruction, if you love your Souls, and wiſh their good and happineſs, if you would not be your Deſtroyers and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, if you have ſo much love to your Souls, that you would they ſhould be Saved, and would not that they be Damned, then come unto Chriſt, then be followers of Chriſt; then believe, then repent, and obey the Goſpel. If you love your Selves be Holy, if you love your Selves be Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, if you love your Selves be humble, be painfull, be circumſpect, and walk in all things as becometh the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. By the way, I exhort you to improve and maintain your true Self-love: I ſay not to you only, Huſbands love your Wives, Parents love your Children, Chriſtians love one another; but every one of you, love your Selves. If you love your Selves, you will love God, if you love your Selves, you
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48705:66"/>
will love Chriſt; if you love your Selves, you will love Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if you love your Selves, you will be the followers of God, the Diſciples of Chriſt, and will give your ſelves to live godly in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> See therefore that you love your Selves, that your poor Souls may grow more dear to you. Be more Zealous for the Salvation of your own Souls, be more fearful of their Damnation, be more tender of wounding and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Souls. Take heed of ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36. <hi>He that ſinneth wrongeth his own Soul; all they that hate me, love Death.</hi> You that ſin againſt God, ye wrong your own Souls. Love your Souls better, and you will never be ſuch proud Livers, or ſuch Worldlings, or ſuch Drunkards, or Rioters; you would be ſober, and ſerious, and circumſpect: If you lov'd your Selves better, you would take heed of this Lying, and theſe Oaths, and this unrighteous Dealing, of this hardneſs of Heart in your ſins; you would fall upon your Knees, you would fall upon your Faces, and be aſhamed, and bewail and repent of your ſins, and return to the Lord from them all, had you more of this true Self-love within you.</p>
            <p>Sinners, why come you not in to Chriſt? Why will you not yet be perſwaded to repent? Why Man, haſt thou no love to thy Self? The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.29. <hi>No Man ever yet hated his own Fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.</hi> He uſeth that word, to preſs Huſbands to love their Wives, who, ſays he, are their own Fleſh. Doſt thou not love thy Self? What wouldſt thou ſay of a Man, that doth not love his Wife, but would play the Tyrant and Tygre, brawling and ſnarling, yea fighting and beating her? You would ſay, This were a Monſter among Men, rather than a Chriſtian; worſe than the very Brutes, amongſt whom it's ſeldom ſeen, that the Male ſnarleth, or biteth, or puſheth at the Female. What then is he that loveth not his own Soul? Loveſt thou thy Self? Loveſt thou thine own Soul? Then take heed of going on in thy Sins; then take heed of ſtanding it out againſt Chriſt. You hear what a reward there is for the Righteous, you hear what an Inheritance Chriſt hath laid up for his Saints; an Inheritance in Light, Life, Love, Joy, everlaſting Pleaſure, and everlaſting Glory; Chriſt would make thoſe poor Souls, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Souls, joyful Souls, glorious Souls, partakers of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Riches of his Glory and Joy: But what, wilt thou ſay, My Soul ſhall have no part in it? My Soul ſhall never come there; my Lot ſhall never be with the Saints, but ſhall be without, amongſt Unbelievers, Impenitents, amongſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48705:66"/>
Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters? In refuſing to come to Chriſt, to Repent, and be made Holy, thou ſayeſt in effect, my Soul ſhall never come to Heaven? Let it to Hell, amongſt Dogs, and Devils, and that vile and wicked Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Damned. But Sinner, haſt thou forgot that thou art a Man? Art thou a Monſter of Men? Haſt thou loſt all love to thy Self, to thine own Soul? Doeſt thou neither love nor pity thine own Soul? Wouldſt thou that Chriſt ſhould ever love thee, when thou whilt not love thy Self? Wouldſt thou that Chriſt ſhould ever pity thee, when thou wilt not pity thy ſelf?</p>
            <p>O Sinners, love your own Souls, pity your own Souls, be not ſo cruel and hard-hearted to your ſelves. Will you for the love of your Luſts, for the love of the World, ſell your Souls to the Devil, ſell them to Hell, to make Faggots for the everlaſting Burnings? Where are your Bowels? O pity, pity that poor blind and miſerable Soul of thine, and bring it to Chriſt for pity's ſake; go on in thy evil ways no longer, be a Drunkard no longer, a Worldling no longer, a Lyar, a Scoffer no longer, be no longer hardned in your ſins, but come away to Chriſt, and eſcape for your Lives; if you love your Selves, come, if you have any pity for your Selves, come; let the dread of the Cruelties of the Devil, bring you back from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, and come you in, and caſt your Selves upon the Blood, upon the Bowels, and Compaſſions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is ſuch an High Prieſt, as can have compaſſion upon the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and thoſe that are out of the way, and even on the worſt of Sinners, that will return to him. What ſhall I ſay more to you? I will ſpeak but the ſame words, let every one of you ſee that he ſo love [himſelf] as Chriſt loved the Church, waſhing it and ſaving it by his Blood. Love your Selves, and ſave your Selves; love your Selves, and bleſs your Selves in the God of Truth. Don't bleſs your ſelves in the Earth, in your Money, in your Lands, in your carnal Pleaſures, in your carnal Friends; theſe things are not, nor ever think they will be, your Bleſſedneſs; but bleſs your Selves in the God of Truth; bleſs your Selves in <hi>Jeſus, whom God hath ſent to bleſs you, in turning you from your Iniquities,</hi> Act. 3.26. Turn to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and you ſhall be bleſſed; be Believers and you ſhall be Bleſſed; come in this day, and let your Names be written among the bleſſed of the Lord; come every one of you, and put in your Names among the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Let me be one, Lord, let me be another, write down
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48705:67"/>
my Name for one among thy Diſciples; I am willing to be thine, and do ſolemnly covenant, and this very day give my Self to Thee. Who of you are there that will thus come in? Will you be perſwaded to it, or muſt I loſe my labour? Are there any of you? Is there any one of all the Sinners in this Company, that will thus come in? Come then in the Name of the Lord; come get your Names to be thus written in the Lamb's Book, and and he will write it in Heaven, there it will be found in the laſt Day, written in the Book of Life; this do, and then you that have been hitherto the Haters, and Wrongers, and Cruel, will hence-forth appear to be Lovers of your own Souls.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a Love of miſtaken Self;</hi> of Carnal-ſelf, a love of the Fleſh, and it's Affections and Luſts; a love of that Fleſh which <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have us to hate and deny, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>[Himſelf]</hi> that is his Fleſh, or Carnal-ſelf; Men are miſtaken in themſelves, and count that their Self which is not their Self; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4. concerning her Husband, <hi>He that thou haſt</hi> for an Huſband, <hi>is not thine Husband;</hi> ſo may it be ſaid to Sinners, That which thou takeſt for thy Self, is not thy Self; this Fleſh which thou takeſt for thy Self, and loveſt as thy Self, is not thy Self. You that love your Fleſh, you love your Enemy; you that pleaſe your Fleſh, you are pleaſing your Enemy; you that are working for your Fleſh, and providing for your Fleſh, and pampering your Fleſh, you are working for, and feeding your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; you count you are ſeeking of, and working for your Self; no, 'tis for your Enemy; this Fleſh is your Mortal Enemy. Now this is one ſort of ſinfull Self-love, when we love our Fleſh, or our corruptions; when we love our Selves, as Fleſhly-minded Men; when we love to pleaſe, and provide for, and ſatisfie our fleſhly minds, when we foſter and cheriſh this Fleſh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>An inordinate love of our Selves Natural;</hi> when we love that which is our Selves, more or otherwiſe than we ought to love it. Our Natural Selves, our Bodies and our Souls are to be loved, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> We ought to love

our ſelves, not our Souls only, but our Bodies alſo, and ſo to love them as to ſeek the good and well-being of our ſelves; not only our Eternal but our Temporal well-being; we may love our eaſe, and our freedom from Pain; we may love our Credit, and our freedom from Reproach and Diſgrace; we may love our mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and freedom from want; yea, we may love our beauty and comelineſs, and freedom from Deformity; and we may ſo love as to maintain and provide for our ſelves in all theſe reſpects; to maintain our ſelves in Health, to preſerve our ſelves from temporal miſery, to provide for our temporal neceſſities; but now our ſinful Self-love is, when we love our Selves more or otherwiſe than we ſhould.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When we love our ſelves more than God:</hi> When we love our ſelves to the neglect of God; as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me,</hi> ſo may it be ſaid, he that loveth himſelf, his own fleſh, his own life, more than me, <hi>is not worthy of me.</hi> Much more, when our Self-love makes an abatement of our love to God, when Self is lov'd ſo much, that God is lov'd the leſs, when the more Self is minded or cared for, by ſo much the leſs God is regarded.</p>

When we love Self as ſeparated from God, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in ſubordination to God, when our love deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in Self, and riſes no higher; every man ſhould love himſelf, but it muſt be for the ſake of God, whoſe ſervant he is, and whoſe Image he bears.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When we love our ſelves to the prejudice of the love of our Neighbour:</hi> The word is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> thou ſhalt love thy ſelf, but ſo, as it may not hinder thee from loving thy Neighbour. When ſelf Monopolizes our love, when our Love which ſhould be a Common, is an Encloſure, and is impropriated and confined to our ſelves; when we ſo intenſely love our ſelves, that we love no body elſe, or care for no body elſe, or at leaſt love not others ſo much as we ſhould; when we care not whom we diſpleaſe, ſo we may but pleaſe our ſelves; when we care not whom we neglect, ſo we may provide for our ſelves; when we care not how it be with others, let them be in ſickneſs, let them be in want, let them ſtarve, let them die, we care not how it be with them, ſo it be but well with our ſelves, when our Self-love is only for the advancing of Self-Intereſt, and will invade and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48705:68"/>
encroach upon, and wrong the Intereſt of others, when we can thereby advance our own. Lay theſe things together, and therein you may ſee, what ſinful Self-love is, a love of miſtaken Self, or an inordinate love of our natural Self.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſinful Self-love is the great Heart-Idolatry, and the root of all Rebellion and Diſobedience to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is the great Heart-Idolatry.</hi> Whatever we love more than God, we make it a God; yea, when we love any thing equal with God, or in ſeparation from God, and not in ſubordination to God. If we love our Selves only for our Selves, we therein deny the God which is above: As he that loves Riches only for Riches ſake, as he that loves his meat and drink, only for the Pleaſure he hath in eating and drinking, ſo he that loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, only for ſelfs ſake, is an Idolater. Whatever we make our laſt end, we make our God: Therefore as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye do,</hi> ſo whatever ye love, or regard, or deſire, let it be all, let it be only <hi>for the glory of God.</hi> Rom. 11.36. <hi>To him are all things;</hi> by him they were made, and to him they muſt be directed. O Beloved, what an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous piece is the Heart of man become! O what an Idolatrous Heart is there then in every one of us! Is Self-love Idolatry? then who of us can be free from this charge of Idolatry? we have every one of us more or leſs ſet up this Idol Self in our Hearts. Do we not love miſtaken Self, our ſinful fleſh? do not our Hearts go after our Covetouſneſs, our carnal Eaſe, our carnal Pleaſures? do we not love that carnal Self which ſhould be denyed, which ſhould be Mortified and Crucified? do none of us ſo love, as to cheriſh our fleſh, and make proviſion for the fleſh? thou haſt a Proud Heart, and doſt thou not maintain and keep up that Self-eſteem? thou haſt a covetous Heart, and doſt not thou nouriſh and feed thy covetouſneſs? thou haſt a Luſt after thy carnal Pleaſure and Liberty, and thou Indulgeſt it all thou canſt; thou loveſt to be high, thou loveſt to be Rich, thou loveſt thy Pleaſure and thy Liberty; theſe things thou loveſt, and doſt thou not love them more than God? the more thou luſteſt after theſe things, and the more thou haſt of them, is not God ſo much leſs loved and regarded? Doſt thou not know, that if thou
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48705:68"/>
hadſt checked and croſſed that proud mind, if thou hadſt denyd that covetous Heart, the Lord God ſhould have had more of thy regard, more of thy Love than now he hath had? do you not think you ſhould have lov'd God better if you had lov'd the World leſs, or your Eaſe, or your Appetites leſs? behold theſe things have broken in and encroacht upon Gods right, have carried away Gods due; this Self, for whoſe ſake all theſe are loved, this Self hath ſtolen into the Heart, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it away after it.</p>
            <p>O what a woful thing is it, that it ſhould be ſaid of any Profeſſor of Religion, that this ſhould be ſaid of them, it were well for theſe men, or at leaſt better than 'tis with them, if they loved God but as well as they love their fleſh, if they ſerved God as heartily as they ſerve their Covetouſneſs, if they were ſet upon the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God but as much as they are ſet upon pleaſing their Appetites, if they were delighted in God as much as they are delighted in the World, if they could find as much Pleaſure in the meditation of God and Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Religion, as in the buſineſſes of this life! Thou knoweſt it is not thus with thee, thou doſt not Love and Delight thy Self in God, as thou loveſt and delighteſt thy Self in this earth and fleſh. Is Communion with God, is communing with thy own Heart about the things of God, is converſing with God in Prayer, in holy Contemplation and Meditation; is the exerciſing thy Faith on God, thy Hope on God, and thy looking into the Goſpel of God, and ſearching out and feeding upon the Blood and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and unſearchable Treaſures laid up in Chriſt; is the exerciſing thy ſelf in theſe things as great a Pleaſure to thee, and doſt thou find as great a delight in them, as thou findeſt in eating and drinking, in buying and ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and getting gain? doſt thou love to be Praying or to be Praiſing the Lord, as thou loveſt to be getting Money? doſt thou love to be ſending thine Heart to Heaven, and there to ſolace it in the thoughts and joyes of the Lord, as thou loveſt to be thinking of thy Corn, or thy Cattel, or thy Income by thy Trade? Thou knoweſt thou doſt not. Canſt thou ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.1, 2. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, Oh Lord, my Soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for thy Courts, mine Heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O what a Heart haſt thou? what doſt thou think of thy Self? art not thou an Idolater, a lover of Money more than a Lover of God, a lover of Pleaſures more than a lover of God, a lover of thy Self and fleſh more than a lover of God? and yet, art thou not an Idolater? doth thine Heart go a Whoring after thine Idols, run away from God after thy Money, run away from God after thy Pleaſures, run away from God after thy Self and fleſh, and yet not an Idolater? art thou an Idolater then, an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Chriſtian, an Idolatrous Profeſſor? O! how is it that ſuch a thought does not fill thy Face with ſhame, and ſet thy Soul a weeping, and cauſe trembling and aſtoniſhment to take hold upon thee? what Friends, is it nothing with you to be Idolaters, to have Idolatrous Hearts, whoring Hearts, whoring from God, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after your fleſh and the Luſts thereof? ſure Friends it would make the beſt of our Hearts to ake, if we were ſenſible, what degrees of this Idolatry there were to be found in every one of us; and many of us I fear, it would convince that they are Idolaters to ſo high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that there is nothing of true and real love to God in them.</p>

It is the rottenneſs of the Heart, under all its moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Religious pretences or performances. All ſincere Religion is animated by the love of God; the love of God is the Soul of Religion. If there be no love to God in our profeſſion of Religion, if no love to God in our practices of Piety, if no love to God in our Prayers, no love to God in our Faſtings and Alms, all our Religion is rotten at Heart; Self-love, which is it's only Root, is it's rotteneſs; Self-love will</p>

So much profeſſing, ſo much Praying and Hearing, as will conſiſt with our Eaſe and our ſafety, as will not put us to too much pains, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to too much danger and reproach; ſo much Religion, as will not hold us in too ſtrictly and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

and cloſely, Self-love will bear it; but where the Yoak of Chriſt wrings and galls, there it muſt be thrown off.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It will corrupt our Religion, and turn it into Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi> Selfiſh Profeſſors are Hypocrites, and all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is Hypocriſie, and Hypocriſie is the rottenneſs of the Heart.

It is love to God, wherein our ſincerity lies; Self-love is our Hypocriſie; and where this rotten Self-love hath tainted your Hearts, your Hearts will taint and corrupt all your Duties, it will pervert and corrupt all that ever you do, and turn it into quite another thing; your Religion is no Religion, your Chriſtianity is no Chriſtianity, your Praying is no Praying, your Spirituality is but fleſhlineſs, your Heavenly-mindedneſs is but Earthineſs, your ſeeming fruitfulneſs is but Emptineſs and barrenneſs: <hi>Iſrael is an empty Vine, he bringeth forth his Fruits to himſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 10.1. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeemed to be a fruitful Vine, that had her Cluſters upon it; there were Cluſters of Prayers, and Cluſters of Sacrifices, and Cluſters of Alms; <hi>Iſrael</hi> had their Fruits, and yet they were but a Barren and empty Vine; how ſo? Why whatever Fruits they had, they were all brought forth to Self; Self brought them forth, and Self eat them up; there was nothing for God, <hi>Iſrael</hi> was an empty Vine to him, her Fruits were to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Friends, would you not be rejected for Barren empty Vines; for falſe-hearted and rotten Profeſſors? Would you not be found rotten at the Core? See that it be the Love of God, and not this Self-love, lying at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, at the Root of your Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is the Root of all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmercifulneſs to Men.</hi> Self-love will never learn that Leſſon, <hi>to do to others as it would be done by;</hi> it will catch all it can; and keep all it has; Self muſt be advanced, Self muſt be enriched, whoever be ruined by it; all manner of Frauds and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, all manner of Oppreſſions and Wrongs, all Mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminings, all Mens over-reachings of their Neighbours, all Mens falſhoods in their Words, their Promiſe-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, their Lyings, all their falſhood in their Dealings, in their Tradings, in their deceitful Words, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful

Weights and Meaſures, all this Unrighteouſneſs, 'tis their Self-love that puts them upon it; ſo they may get for themſelves, and enrich themſelves, how wicked ſoever the means or wayes be to it, they care not who be impoveriſhed or ruined. And where Self will not ſuffer Men to be Righteous, it will leſs ſuffer them to be Merciful; what they are ſo much for getting, they will be but little for giving: the Hunger and Nakedneſs, the pinching and Pining, and even Starving of ſo many poor amongſt us, the ſhort Alms they can get, and that little, that it's ſo hardly come by, the failing of Compaſſions, the ſhutting up of Bowels againſt thoſe that are in need, this is all from Self-love. I ſhall need it for my ſelf, I need it for mine own, I cannot ſpare it, that's often the Word, that muſt go in ſtead of an Alms.</p>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>It's the Root of Self-ſeeking.</hi> Holy Self-love is the Root of Holy Self-ſeeking; as the love of God is the Root of ſeeking God, ſo ſinful Self-love, is the Root of all ſinful ſelf-ſeeking; and ſinful ſelf-ſeeking, is contrary to the ſeeking of God.

            <p>And as there hath been an interchangeable communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of loves, and Eſpouſal of Intereſt, betwixt Chriſt and Chriſtians, ſo alſo betwixt Chriſtians and Chriſtians; as we have ſaid to our Lord, I am thine, ſo we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſaid one to another, I am yours, and muſt therefore walk in that tenderneſs of love, in that dearneſs of affection one to another, in that mutual care of each others good, in that mutual Senſe of each others afflictions, in that mutual delight in each others Societies, in that mutual helping and counſelling and comforting one another, and hearty ſeeking and rejoicing in each others good, ſtudying to pleaſe each other for his good to Edification, fearing to grieve, or offend, or wrong, or fall out with, or quarrel one with another; counting the Intereſt of every Chriſtian to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt of the whole Body; that we hereby may prove, that we love one another, <hi>not in Word and in Tongue; but Indeed and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This now is the Nature, and theſe are the Fruits of Divine Love; it will unite Hearts, and unite Intereſts; this will be the Intereſt of Chriſtians, which will flow from the love of Chriſt, that Chriſt's Intereſt proſper in the World; that the Name of Chriſt be exalted, and be honourable, both in themſelves and in the World; that Chriſt be loved, that Chriſt be praiſed; that the Word of Chriſt, the Worſhip of Chriſt, his Sabbaths, his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, be exalted in the World; that the Glory and Holy Image of Chriſt, his Humility, Meekneſs, Lowlineſs, Heavenlineſs, Righteouſneſs, Mercy, may ſhine forth in our Faces, and in the Faces and Wayes of all his Saints; that we may in our particulars, and jointly, ſhew forth the Spirit and Life of ſerious and poweful Religion and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in all manner of Holy Converſation; this we ſhould account our Intereſt with reſpect to Chriſt, that he may be thus Honour'd and Obeyed; and this will be the Intereſt of Chriſtians with reſpect to Chriſtians, that we may ſee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48705:72"/>
one another, the whole Vineyard flouriſhing in the Power of Holineſs, as living and lively Inſtances of the Grace of God; and (as far as the Lord ſee it good) may ſee one another proſpering in this World, even as our Souls do proſper.</p>
            <p>O Chriſtians, eſpouſe this common Intereſt, and do what you can to promote this Intereſt in the World; Love Chriſt, and lift up the Name of Chriſt; love Chriſt and ſhew forth the Image of Chriſt; love Chriſt and Conſecrate your Life to Chriſt; determine to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to value nothing, to rejoice in nothing, but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and him Crucified. And then love one another, and ſtudy to pleaſe one another, to profit one another, for their good to Edification; to caſt in your Lot together, to rejoice together with them that rejoice, to grieve with them that ſuffer, to live together in love, forbearing one another, forgiving one another, comforting one another, even as you your ſelves would be Loved, forgiven, and comforted of God.</p>
            <p>This now is the nature and the fruit of Divine Love, it unites Intereſts; but Self-love, ſinful Self-love divides Intereſts, and ſo thoſe that ſeek the things of Self, their carual things, ſeek not the things of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sinful Self-love hath a root remaining in the beſt Hearts,</hi> even of the regenerate; though in Converſion Self hath loſt the Domlnion, and be caſt down from the Throne, yet is there a ſecret Tabernacle, a corner in the Heart, where it fortifies it Self, and is ſtill aſpiring to recover the Throne it hath loſt; the Dominion yet it retains, in ſome degree; an Intereſt in the affection, and by this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it hath the advantage of us, and often recovers too great a Command again.</p>
            <p>How great a Power ſinful Self-love hath ſtill in us, the experience of Chiſtians ſadly proves; for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, conſider yet again more diſtinctly, that there is, as hath been already hinted, a threefold Self-love, and accordingly a threefold Self-ſeeking.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a loving or ſeeking our ſelves, in conjunction with God, and in ſubordination to him.</hi> This is a loving or ſeeking Self ſpiritually, a loving or ſeeking of Self as Chriſtians, as the Servants of God and Members of Chriſt, as cloathed with the Image, and devoted to the ſervice, and aſpiring to the Salvation of God. This Self-loving
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48705:73"/>
and Self-ſeeking is our duty and our excellency; the Intereſt of Self ſpiritual and the Intereſt of God, are a conjunct Intereſt, only the Intereſt of Self is lower, and ſubordinate to the Intereſt of God. When we thus ſeek our ſelves, our Spiritual and Eternal good, we are therein moſt effectually ſeeking God, we cannot more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſeek God than in ſeeking our own Salvation. Thoſe that ſeek Glory, Honour and Immortality, for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do therein ſeek the Glory and Honour of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal God; thereby declaring that they prize and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Lord, as their chief, nay, the only good. He that neglecting theſe lower things, doth ſeeek God as his onely happineſs, doth therein take the Crown off the head of all his Idols, and ſet it where it ought to be, on the Head of the moſt High. By our ſeeking of God above all, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by evidently declare, that we Prize him and Honour him above all; our thus ſeeking of God, is trampling into dirt all thoſe Idols, the Vanities of the World, which ſtood in Competition with God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a Loving and Seeking our ſelves in ſeparation from God.</hi> This is our loving and ſeeking Self natural, the good of our Perſons, our Bodies and Souls, without conſidering them as bearing a reſpect to God. Our ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our well-being as meer men; our bodily well-being, our Health, and Strength, and natural Activity; the well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or perfecting our Souls; our ſeeking Wiſdom, and Knowledge, and Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe things are all good, and worth our ſeeking in their place; our bodily health and ſtrength are good; Wiſdom, and Knowledge, and Learning are good; Health is better than Sickneſs, Strength than weakneſs; Wiſdom is better than Folly, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than Ignorance; he hath more of the excellency of a man, who is a Learned man, than he that is but an Idiot; but now the ſeeking theſe good things, <hi>as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from God,</hi> the ſeeking Health and not for God, the ſeeking Strength and not for God, the ſeeking Wiſdom and Learning and not for God, this is a ſinful Self-ſeeking: As the Lord ſpake, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his Wiſdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his Might, let not the Rich man glory in his Riches, but let him that glorieth Glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me.</hi> So may it be ſaid, Let not this Might be ſought, this Wiſdom be ſought, but in order to the underſtanding, knowing and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48705:73"/>
ſerving of me. Thoſe that ſeek only Lawful things for themſelves, and in Lawful and Honeſt ways, that ſeek Health, and Strength, that ſeek Eſtates, that ſeek Wiſdom and Knowledge, and all theſe in Lawful and Honeſt ways, yet if they ſeek theſe good things, theſe Lawful things, only for themſelves, and not with reſpect to God; if they ſeek not God in ſeeking their Health and Eſtates, if they do not ſeek God in their ſeeking Wiſdom and Underſtanding, this is a Sinful and Idolatrous Self-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It may be, thou mayeſt not be an Epicure, or a Drunkard, or a Glutton, in thy Eating and Drinking thou art ſober and temperate, and eateſt only for thy Health; It may be, thou mayeſt not be Unjuſt, or an Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in ſeeking an Eſtate for thy ſelf, yet for all this, thou mayeſt be an Idolater, and an Idolater thou art if thou ſeekeſt any of theſe things for thy ſelf, and not God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is a loving or ſeeking of our ſelves, in oppoſition to God;</hi> a ſeeking Self-carnal. 'Tis true, ſeeking our ſelves in Separation, is ſeeking our ſelves in Oppoſition to God, but this ſeeking Self-carnal is in an higher and more direct Oppoſition to God. Self-carnal is an Enemy to God, and ſeeking Self thus, is the maintaining and cheriſhing that Enmity; he that inordinately ſeeks his Eaſe, or the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Appetite and Senſes, does therein do what he can to feed and pamper that Enemy, his fleſh, that it may wax wanton, and head-ſtrong, and kick againſt God.</p>
            <p>Now however every Convert hath decreed, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſeek himſelf, only in conjunction and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God, to ſeek himſelf in the Lord and for the Lord; yet this ſinful Self-love hath a Root remaining in him, which will be putting forth in ſinful ſelf-ſeeking. That word, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>All ſeek their own,</hi> was ſpoken of Chriſtians; there were ſuch declinings and ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions gotten into the Churches, into the very Hearts of Profeſſors, as unhappily engaged them in this Self-ſeeking. <hi>[All]</hi> that is the moſt, 'twas a too general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, there were many Sick of it. <hi>And not the things of Chriſt;</hi> (that is,) not ſo heartily, not ſo zealouſly, not ſo Naturally, as 'twas ſaid of <hi>Timothy,</hi> Phil. 2.20. <hi>He did Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally care for the things and ſtate of the Church, and of God;</hi> but ſays the Apoſtle, However it was with him, <hi>I have no Man like minded;</hi> I find few <hi>Timothies</hi> among you;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48705:74"/>
whileſt he is ſeeking the things of Chriſt, moſt of you are ſeeking your own things, and not the things of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>How much of this ſelf-love, and ſelf-ſeeking, is to be found amongſt Chriſtians, we have ſad experiences enough to prove; we need not go to Scripture for proof, we find too evident Proofs in our own Hearts and Lives; if we have not totally gone back from Chriſt to Self, yet have we not ſuffered this Idol to divide with Chriſt? O let us enquire a little.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Do we ſeek our ſelves and our own Intereſts, only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conjunction with Chriſt, and in ſubordination to Chriſt?</hi> Do we count nothing our own things, but what are the things of Chriſt? Have we heatily eſpouſed the Intereſt of Chriſt, as our own Intereſt? Do we ſeek nothing in this World ſo, but that we can truly call it, ſeeking of Chriſt? Do we ſeek our Healths, and our Eſtates, and our ſafety, as the Servants of Chriſt? Can we call our labouring in our Callings, our aiming at Thriving and Proſperity in our Affairs, can we call this, and call it truly ſo, our Serving of Chriſt? If we would have Health and Strength, is it for Chriſt we would have it? If we would have Eſtates in the World and be Rich, is it for the ſake of Chriſt that we would be Rich? That we may as <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Honour the Lord with our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?</hi> Do we mark up all we can get, and all we have, do we mark it up for Chriſt? Is there Holineſs to the Lord written upon all our Houſes and Poſſeſſions? This Houſe is the Lords, and theſe Lands are the Lords; 'tis for him I have gotten them, and for him I will uſe them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Do we not rather Seek theſe things in ſeparation from God?</hi> Seek them for themſelves, for the love we have to them, for the ſake of Self, to whoſe ſervice we devote them? do we not ſeek theſe things, with the neglect of Chriſt? Is not Chriſt ſought the leſs, and the more grieved for that the World is ſought ſo much? Is not Chriſt the leſs minded, the leſs loved, the more ſeldom thought on by this means? Does not our Thriftineſs and good Huſbandry for the World, our Eating and Feeding upon, our taking the Pleaſure of what we have here, does not this make an abatement upon our Chriſtianity? Do we not loſe much of the Life and Spirit and Soul of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in our Carnal things and delights? Do we not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48705:74"/>
ſo bleſs our ſelves in this Earth, that we ſo much the leſs bleſs our ſelves in Chriſt, or in the God of Truth? Chriſtians, pray conſider it; how do ye find it? Hath not this Selfiſhneſs and Earthlineſs ſpoyled you for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? Of how many Mens Proſpering in the World, of how many Mens labouring for the World, may it be ſaid, This is the Fruit of theſe Labours, this is the Fruit of this Proſperity, it hath even ſpoyled a good Chriſtian, he hath loſt his Love, and loſt his Life, and loſt his Zeal for God, in his loving and caring and good huſbandry for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Pray conſider, if this be none of your caſes; and if this be not a ſad caſe, and whether you can take any comfort in it or no? Had not thoſe Hearts need to be look'd to, that have thus gone a Whoring, ('tis no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that have gone a whoring from Chriſt, after the World? Haſt thou govern'd that Heart of thine well, which thou haſt ſuffered thus to play the Harlot? Haſt thou not need of looking better to it? Chriſtians, do you not ſee you had need to be more watchful over your Hearts, and to hold them in under a cloſer and ſeverer reſtraint, than you have hitherto done?</p>
            <p>Again, if you do not ſee how far ſinful Self-love hath prevailed in you above the Love of God, conſider further for conviction: 1. <hi>Do you love them that love God, as you love them that love your Selves?</hi> There's ſcarce any Man that is ſo ill natur'd, but will love thoſe that love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Do not even the Publicans the ſame? Mat.</hi> 5. They love thoſe that love them, and are beneficial to them; But do you love thoſe that love God, as you love thoſe that love your ſelves? Thoſe that are loving and kind and friendly to you, you will love them, whether they love God or no; and do you find that thoſe that love God, you can love them, whether they love you or no? If they ſhould any of them be unkind, and unfriendly to you, yet can you love them, becauſe they love God? If not, if you can love them that love you, though they do not love God, and cannot love them who love God, in caſe they do not love you, what think you? Is not this an evidence, that this Self-love hath greater power in you, than the love of God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Are you angry with thoſe that offend God, as you are with thoſe that offend your Selves?</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> could ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21, 22. <hi>Do not I hate them that hate thee?
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48705:75"/>
am not I grieved with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee? Yea I hate them with a perfect hatred; I count them mine Enemies:</hi> Can you ſay ſo? I am angry with them that are angry with thee: I am grieved at them, that ſin againſt God, thoſe that are his Enemies, I count them mine own Enemies. Thoſe that wrong our ſelves, and offend our ſelves, that wrong us in our Names, by traducing, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting or ſlandering of us, that wrong us of our Right, by Fraud or Oppreſſion, that do but ſpeak an angry or unkind word to us, how quickly does the Fire kindle? We are too hot and touchy, when Self is concerned; but are we grieved, are we offended at thoſe that ſin againſt God? yea, even though they be never ſo kind to our ſelves? Can we not wink at ſin in our Friends, can we not palliate and excuſe it, and hide our eyes from the ſins of them whom we love, and upon whoſe kindneſs and friendſhip ſelf hath ſome dependance? How then canſt thou ſay, thou loveſt God as thou loveſt thy ſelf? Touch ſelf-Intereſt who dare, he ſhall not eſcape thy wrath; let him kick againſt God, ſin againſt Chriſt, and thou art never moved; Doſt thou love God as thou loveſt thy ſelf? It was ſaid of Holy <hi>Calvin,</hi> that when he heard that <hi>Luther</hi> call'd him Devil, that he anſwered, But he is the Servant of the moſt High God; 'tis ſaid of <hi>Lot,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.8. <hi>That Righteous Man living among the</hi> Sodomites, <hi>vexed his Righteous Soul with the filthy Converſation of thoſe wicked Ones. Lot</hi> had none of the beſt Neighbours in thoſe wicked <hi>Sodomites;</hi> doubtleſs he ſuffer'd many Perſonal wrongs and unkindneſſes from them, that Righteous Man could never be Neighbour to ſuch wicked ones, without ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them himſelf; but yet we read not, that he ever fretted or vexed at any thing they did againſt himſelf; their wickedneſs againſt God, their filthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, this was it which vexed his Righteous Soul. There was a Man that loved God indeed; ſilent at wrongs done to himſelf, only vexed at what is done againſt God. Is it ſo with thee? Is it ſo with us? O how quite contrary are we? Vexing, and fretting, and chafing at whatever is againſt our ſelves, and ſilent and quiet, and not moved in the concerns of God? Is this our love to God? Are we lovers of God more than lovers of Self? Sure, beloved, this very thing, our being ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of Self-offences, and ſo patient of offences againſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48705:75"/>
God, this very thing, if well conſidered, might make the moſt of our Hearts to ake, and draw Tears from our Eyes, might ſet us all a Weeping, to think what daily Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have of this kind, to prove how powerful this Self-love, and how weak the love of God is in us. Sure the more dear the Lord grows to us, the more will it go to our Hearts, that he ſhould be offended by any, and the more Self-love were mortified, the eaſier ſhould we bear Self-wrongs and Offences.</p>
            <p>And what can we ſay with reſpect to our Brethren Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Do we not ſo love our ſelves, but that we are heartily concern'd for our Neighbours? Have we compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions towards them in their afflictions? Do we rejoice at their Proſperity? Can we grieve with thoſe that grieve, ſuffer with them that ſuffer, and rejoice with them that rejoyce and proſper? We can be glad when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpereth our Selves, and can we be glad when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpereth others? O how do Men rake and catch what they can, one from another? how do Men envy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of their Neighbours? O how do ſome Men gape after the Poſſeſſions of their Brethren, wiſhing even for their Death, when they are like to get any thing by it? How many Landlords are glad of the death of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants? How many younger Brothers are glad at the death of the Heir? Yea, how do ſome Children wait for the death of their Parents, that the Inheritance may fall to themſelves? And whence is all this wickedneſs? Is not this from Self-love? O what Murtherous deſires and hopes doth it ſometimes bring forth? Though it dare not put upon Murtherous Practices, though it doth not make Murtherous hands, yet it often makes the Heart a Murtherous heart, and fills it with Murtherous deſires and practices, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murthers, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</hi> 'Tis this Self in the Heart, that is the Original Murtherer and Adulterer. You that are Profeſſors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſee diligently whether there be no degree of this wickedneſs to be found in any of your Hearts; to hope for, to wiſh for, or at leaſt to be well pleaſed at the death of others, when Self doth get by their Death: Therefore</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There is a neceſſity of keeping the Heart under Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Is Self ſuch an Idol in the Heart? Is Self-love Idolatry, and the Root of ſo much wickedneſs? The
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48705:76"/>
Rot of Religion? The Root of Unrighteouſneſs, Unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Yea and of ſuch Murtherous deſires and wiſhes? And is there ſomething of this Root remaining even in Chriſtians? And is it apt to put forth into ſuch Self-exaltings, and wicked Self-ſeeking, and will it certainly do ſo, where it is not carefully looked to, and held under ſevere reſtraint; then certainly there's no Government more neceſſary than Heart-Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Wherein the Government of the Heart ſtands;</hi> and it ſtands in theſe Five things:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>In ſubjecting the lower Faculties, the Affections, Appetite and Senſes, to Reaſon and Conſcience.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>In holding the Thoughts upon profitable and pertinent Objects.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>In exerciſing the Paſſions or Affections upon their proper Objects, and within their due Limits and Bounds and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>In ſuppreſſing and keeping under the Evil, and cheriſhing and encouraging the Good that is in the Heart.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>In ſtrengthning the Sinews of Government.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In ſubjecting the lower Faculties, the Affections, Appetite and Senſes, to Reaſon and Conſcience.</hi> Reaſon muſt be Dictator in the Heart, and muſt not be controlled or over-born by the inferiour Faculties. Conſcience is inveſted with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God: Subjection to Reaſon and Conſcience, is ſubjection to God, and Rebellion againſt theſe, is Rebellion againſt God. The Reaſon of all the diſorders in the Heart is the Uſurpation of Senſe and Appetite, and their riſing up againſt Reaſon; when the People take Head againſt their Prince, what diſorders follow? God that ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Lean not to thine own underſtanding;</hi> that is, as corrupted and biaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Fleſh, yet requireth us to lean to our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when they are contradicted and oppoſed by the Fleſh. The Prophet complains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.8. <hi>There is no Judgment in their goings, they have made them crooked Paths;</hi> no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, no Underſtanding, no Conſcience in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and where there is no Underſtanding nor Conſcience, there's nothing but crookedneſs.</p>
            <p>Sinners Hearts do ſet up Senſe and Appetite to be the Ruler; as 'twas ſaid of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 Kings 12.31. <hi>He made the vileſt of the People to be Prieſts;</hi> So ſinners make the vileſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48705:76"/>
and loweſt of their Faculties to be Rulers; they will not be Ruled by Reaſon, they will not be governed by Conſcience, but Affection and Appetite muſt bear the ſway. How comes it to paſs, that thou art ſuch a Carnal ſenſual Liver? Does thy Reaſon tell thee, that a Carnal Worldly Life is the beſt Life? Does thy Conſcience command thee to be Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, or to be a Libertine, to live at thine Eaſe and thy Pleaſure? Does thy Conſcience tell thee, that this is the Life that God would have thee to live? That God would have thee to live in the Ale-houſe; to follow thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or thy Covetouſneſs? It is not againſt thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to be ſober and ſerious and circumſpect in thy goings; 'tis not againſt thy Conſcience to forbear thy Lying, or thy Fraud, or thy Falſhood; no, it is thine Appetite, and thine Affections, to whom thou haſt reſigned thy Self to be governed, that lead thee on thus.</p>
            <p>Would you have good Government to be kept within you? Set up right Government; let reaſon Govern, let Conſcience govern; make your Senſes and your Appetites to know their place, and to keep under, and to be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to your Underſtandings and Conſcience; embrace not any thing meerly becauſe it pleaſes your Senſes, ſeek not any thing becauſe you have an Appetite to it, let not your Affections lead you, but your Judgments and Underſtandings. It would be well, if we were come thus far, <hi>to live according to the beſt of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings;</hi> and ſo far forth as we do ſo, ſo far forth we live under Government; the Anarchy of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering Appetites and Senſes is no Government. Do not your Underſtandings tell you, it is better to live in the love and fear of God, than in the Luſts of the Fleſh? Do not your Judgements tell you, that an holy, ſober, ſerious, heavenly Life, is better than Viciouſneſs or Vanity. Do not your Conſciences call upon you, Love not the World, nor the Wine, and ſtrong Drink; follow not thy Sports and thy Pleaſures, <hi>Fly youthful Luſts?</hi> haſt thou not a Conſcience within thee, that calls thus upon thee? When thy Luſts call thee after thy Pleaſure, when thy Covetouſneſs calls thee after the World, when thy Senſe calls upon thee, Take thine Eaſe, take thy Liberty, haſt thou not a Conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee calling thee back, and charging thee to take heed, and beware of Living thus? When thy Carnal will and thy Luſts call thee from minding Chriſt, and Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs, let it all alone, meddle not with ſuch a ſevere
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48705:77"/>
Life, yet haſt thou not a Conſcience within thee, telling thee, it is beſt for thee to be a ſerious Chriſtian? It would be better for thee if thou wouldſt give thy ſelf to an Holy, Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble godly Life, than to live ſuch a Libertine? It would be better for thee to be a ſincere, ſtrict, diligent, active Chriſtian, than to be ſuch a trifling lazy Hypocrite and looſe Profeſſor? Does not thy Conſcience tell thee thus, and charge thee to be ſuch an one? Why let Conſcience carry it, reſign up thy ſelf to the Government of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In keeping the Thoughts exerciſed upon profitable and pertinent Objects.</hi> I told you before, that the unrulineſs of the Heart lies much in the unrulineſs of the Thoughts; and how much of the Heart government ſtands in the Government of the Thoughts; the beſt way to keep the Thoughts well governed, is to keep them well exerciſed. Thoſe Legions of Thoughts that are in the Heart, are like the Souldiers of an Army; if Souldiers be not kept to Action, they will hardly be kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Command; when they lie idly and lazily in their Quarters, and have nothing to do, then they uſe to Mutiny, and to break out into diſorders; ſound an Alarum, and bring them to their Arms, and that's the beſt way to bring them to Order.</p>
            <p>Keep your diſorderly mutinous Thoughts to exerciſe, and exerciſe them upon what they ought to be exerciſed upon; be thinking <hi>profitable</hi> Thoughts; be thinking upon Chriſt, upon the State of your Souls, upon the work of your Souls; be thinking <hi>pertinent</hi> Thoughts, ſuch as are proper to your preſent caſes, ſuch as are proper to the preſent Seaſon; when you are Hearing, fix your Thoughts intently upon what you hear; when you are Reading, think on what you Read; when you are Praying, think on what you Pray for; when at the Table of the Lord, think on what's before you, upon your Crucified Lord, upon the love, and kindneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of Chriſt to you; upon the Covenant you are Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Afterwards, think of what you have Heard, and Read, and prayed for, and received, and covenanted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do not divert to other good Thoughts that are not pertinent. Impertinent Thoughts though the matter of them be good, are unprofitable Thoughts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.18. <hi>When I awake, I am ſtill with thee;</hi> my Thoughts are with God; as <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>How precious alſo are thy Thoughts to me?

It was a pleaſant thing to him to think of God. 2. <hi>The Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his Thoughts of God;</hi> how great is the Summ of them?

The matter of his Thoughts, the Law of God, or thoſe bleſſed matters, thoſe wonderful things contained in this Law, to be thinking of the Word of God, is to be thinking of God, of Chriſt, of Holineſs, of Heaven, of the way to Heaven, and the like things that are written in the Word, theſe are the matter of his Thoughts. 2. <hi>The Seaſons of his Meditations,</hi> and theſe are, every Seaſon; he is conſtantly thus exerciſed, all the day; his Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts are his continual Thoughts. 3. <hi>The Motive or Spring of his Meditations,</hi> O how I love thy Law! What we love, we ſhall eaſily be thinking of; if we love God, we ſhall be thinking of God, if we love our Souls, love Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, love the Word, and wayes of God, our Thoughts will be upon them. Doſt thou not think on God, and the Law of God? 'Tis a ſign thou loveſt them not; well, this is the right governing our Thoughts, and which will prevent the wandrings and ſtraglings and unrulineſs of them, the holding them thus well exerciſed.</p>

            <p>O, it were well with the ſinful World, better than it is, if they loved God and their Souls, as well as they love their Bodies and Eſtates; but Sinner, for thy part, thou doſt not ſo; thou ſayeſt thou loveſt God, thou ſayeſt thou loveſt thy Soul, thou ſayeſt theſe are the gteat things thine Heart is upon; no, thou doſt not love God as thou loveſt that Carkaſs of thine, thou doeſt not love God as well as thou loveſt thy Money, or thy Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or thy Health; thy very Luſts, thy Carnal Sports and Merriments, thy vile Companions, and thy Sins, thou art ſuch a vile Brute, that thou loveſt theſe more than thou loveſt God or thy Soul; thou art better pleaſed, thou art bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfied, when the Corn and the Wine increaſeth, when thou Proſpereſt in this World, than with any hopes thou haſt towards God for thy Soul. What is the Pleaſure of thine Heart? When art thou moſt merry, and beſt contented?

            <p>O wonder, wonder, Sinners, and be aſtoniſhed at your Selves, that ever there ſhould be ſuch a vile and wretched Heart within you, and yet you ſhould ſit here, or go up and down the World, as well pleaſed with your ſelves, as well ſatisfied with your ſelves, as you are. Who would think, that behold Sinners Faces, how merry they look; who would think theſe merry ones, ſhould have ſuch a vile and wicked Heart within them?</p>
            <p>How is it with thee Sinner? What aileth thee? I am well, I thank God: Well art thou? What, and have ſuch a Devil in thy Boſome, ſuch a wicked Heart, as deſpiſeth the Lord, and makes a God of thy Belly, or thy Money, or thy Pleaſure? The Lord make you deeply ſenſible of this wickedneſs, for 'tis certainly your caſes; 'twere better with you than it is, if you had loved God as well as you do the Beaſts that periſh, if you loved your Souls as well as you do thoſe rotting and periſhing Carkaſes.</p>
            <p>And for you that are Chriſtians, who do love your Souls more than your Bodies, and God more than all, yet it is ſo little that God hath the Preheminence in your Love, that you are hard put to it in your Examination, to prove whether the love of God hath the Preheminence in you or no; whether there be not ſomething that you love more than God. It is a ſhame for us, Friends, that the love of God is no more perfected in us; that there is no more ſenſible ſtrength of our Love to God, that we ſhould be ſo often put to it, to Queſtion which we love beſt, God or our ſelves, God or this preſent World. Well, this ſhould be the Order and Meaſure of your Love, as I ſaid before, that God be firſt loved, next our Souls, then our Bodies, and after that the Creatures which are for the Bodily Proſperity; that the Creature be loved no farther than it is ſerviceable to the Health of our Bodies, and our Bodies loved in order to the ſervice of our Souls, and all ſo much, and no more, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to the Honour and Service of God; this ſhould be the Order and Meaſure of our Love, and this would be one Fruit of the due Government of our Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:48705:79"/>That I may the more effectually perſwade you to ſet up and keep up this Government in your Hearts, let me aſk you,</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Can you except againſt this Order and Meaſure of your Love?</hi> Order in the Heart, is as neceſſary as Order in a Kingdom, Army, or Family; and a due Order in our Love, is neceſſary to the keeping up Order in the Heart.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>Order in the Heart is as neceſſary as Order in a Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. What is a Kingdom, if there be no Order in it? What is an Army, what is a Family, where there is no order in it? What is there but Confuſion and Ruin? All runs into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, all runs to ruin where no Order is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Where envy and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work;</hi> where envy and ſtrife is, there is diſorder; good Order would prevent ſtrife and envying; and where no good Order is, there is confuſion and every evil work; O what Tumults and Mutinies are there in our diſorderly Hearts! there is no good doing, and there is every evil work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Order in our Love is neceſſary to the keeping our whole Hearts in Order:</hi> upon the right Order and Meaſure of our Love, will follow the right Ordering of all our Affections; there's no one of all our Affections but will be in good Order, if our Love be in Order; if we love what we ſhould love, we ſhall hate what we ſhould hate, and fear what we ſhould fear, and deſire what we ſhould deſire, and grieve for what we ſhould grieve, and be angry only at what we ſhould be angry; and when there is a due Meaſure in our Love, where we love as much as we ſhould, we ſhall hate as much as we ſhould, and fear, and grieve, and rejoice as much as we ſhould, and no more; the motions and workings of all our Affections do follow and flow from the working of our Love; as when we love God, we ſhall hate and fear and grieve for all that is contrary to God, ſo when we love God as much as we ſhould, that is above all, and with all our Hearts, we ſhall deſire him above all, and hate and grieve for ſin which is contrary to God, with all our Hearts.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why we hate not ſin as we ſhould, why we fear not ſin, and grieve not for ſin; the Reaſon why we deſire no more after God, why we deſire Grace no more, and Holineſs no more, it is becauſe we have no more love to God and his Holineſs. The Reaſon why we love that we ſhould not love, and deſire and fear what we ſhould not, the Reaſon of our Carnal griefs and Worldly Sorrows,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48705:80"/>
thoſe Sorrows that bring Death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. is becauſe we duly love not God; more love to God would help and heal thoſe inordinate Paſſions; you would never be lovers of this Self, of this Fleſh, of this World, of theſe Pleaſures, did you duly love God and the things of God, you complain of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs of your Paſſions, of your frettings, and vexings and the unquietneſs of your Hearts; you complain of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Hearts, you cannot hate ſin as you ſhould, nor mourn for ſin, nor fear it as you ſhould; this you ſay is your Affliction, and you know not how to help it; why, do but get more love to God, more intenſe and ardent love to Him and his Holineſs, and you will find all theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers to fall, then you will hate and fear and mourn for ſin as you ought to do; there will be an end of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings of hardneſs of Heart, that you can't fear, nor grieve, nor mourn for ſin; there will be an end of your complainings of your over-loving the World, of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable paſſions, and frettings, and anger, at what you ſhould not, when once you have gotten duely to love the Lord.</p>
            <p>Well, by this you ſee the Order in the Heart, and in ſpecial the due Order and Meaſure of your love that is neceſſary, and how neceſſary it is.</p>
            <p>Can you therefore except againſt this Order and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your Love? What ſhould be firſt and chiefly loved? Wilt thou not ſay, That God ſhould be he? Which ſhould be moſt in our Love, our Bodies, or our Souls? Will you not every one ſay, O my Soul, my Soul is of more worth than my Body, and more worthy of my Love? Which ſhould be more loved, your Bodies, or your Eſtates, and the Creatures you enjoy? Surely you would all ſay in this, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25. <hi>The Life is more than Meat, and the Body than Raiment;</hi> what would you think of ſuch a Man, that loves his Money more than his own Body; that would ſuffer his Body to Starve, and Pine, rather than ſpend his Money upon it? you would ſay, This Man is a Monſter; and is not he as much a Monſter who loves his Body more than his Soul, or himſelf more than God, as he who loves his Money more than his Body? Chriſtians, would you not count it well with you, if your Love were thus regulated? What if you could now feel that which you have ſo often queſtioned and doubted, whether it be ſo or no, that you can now love God above all, that the whole ſtream

               </gap> it true beyond queſtion, and you could ſay, Now I feel who hath mine Heart; none but God, none but Chriſt; <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Earth that I love, in compariſon of thee. God is the love of my Heart, and my Portion for ever; what if you could now feel it thus within you? What if from your own ſenſe and experience, you could heartily ſpeak out ſuch words? Take this Heart to thee, O Lord; thine it is, thou art mine only Love, and nothing will I love or regard but in Order to thee; would you not bleſs your ſelves in ſuch an experience? Would it not be Marrow and Fatneſs to your Souls? Would you not rejoyce in the Lord, and triumph in Chriſt, and praiſe his Holy Name, that had wrought you to that paſs? That God ſhould have thus gotten to be the chief in your love, and Self, and Fleſh, and the whole World, were brought to ſtoop and ſtand aſide, yea, and to be trampled on, in compariſon of him? Sure you that are Chriſtians, would count it happy with you if it were thus, and I dare ſay concerning you, this is it you pray for, and hope for, and wait, and thirſt, and long after, and would count it an infinitely greater matter of joy and praiſe, than if the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, if all the Pomps, and Pleaſures, and Grandeur of the World were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing unto you, and were rolling in upon you; and therefore you for your parts have nothing to except againſt this Order and Meaſure of your love.</p>
            <p>Qu. 2. <hi>But how is it with you?</hi> If it be an excellent thing, if it be a bleſſed thing to have our Hearts brought into ſuch a Frame and Order, what do ye find? Are you made partakers of this bleſſedneſs? O the Lord help me, I am far ſhort of it; I can feel that I love this World, I need no tryal whether I love this Fleſh or no, whether I love my Credit or no, whether I love my Money, or my Lands, or mine Eaſe, or my Pleaſures; I feel I love
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48705:81"/>
theſe things, but whether I love my Soul as I ought, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I love God as I ought, there's my great doubt; and I fear I do not. Doſt thou fear? Doſt thou doubt whether thou loveſt thy Soul, as thou loveſt the World? Whether thou loveſt thy God as thou loveſt thy Fleſh? And is there any thing but need then, that thou ſhouldſt be brought to a better paſs? Canſt thou be quiet? canſt thou be comforted in any thing, whileſt it is thus with thee? Chriſtians, would you ever be clearly ſatisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your eternal State, that you ſhall hereafter dwell in the eternal Love? Would you be comforted touching your preſent Caſe, that God is your God; That Chriſt is your Jeſus; That the Covenant, and the Promiſes, and the Mercies of God are yours, that you are paſſed from Death to Life, that your Names are written in Heaven, and that you are Enrolled amongſt the Saints, and ſhall have an Inheritance with the Saints in Light? Then put hard on for this bleſſed Frame of Heart; let it hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be the great thing in your Eye, look for it, pray for it, reach forth towards it; down with this World, tread upon this Earth, and Fleſh, love nothing but what God would have you love, love nothing but in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God. Dread the encroachments of the Creatures upon the Right of God; deſpiſe theſe carnal Pleaſures, deſpiſe this Money, and theſe Lands, or this Credit, ſo far forth as they ſtand in competition with God; ſet your Foot upon the Necks of them all; give your Hearts unto the Lord, and let him be your Love and your Delight, and your Portion for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For our Deſires,</hi> in this as in the former, <hi>we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire what we ſhould deſire, and as much as, and no more than we ſhould deſire it;</hi> the Object of our deſires is the ſame with the Object of our Love; that which is Good.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Other good things are to be deſired in ſubordination and with ſubmiſſion.</hi> And thus the higher Degrees of Grace,

the beſt and moſt advantageous Means of Grace, Gifts, the gift of Prayer, gifts for Edification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe all are to be deſired with ſubmiſſion to the will of God; the firſt Grace, or ſaving Grace we are not to deſire with ſubmiſſion (ſo as to be content to be deny'd it) no not to the will of God; for there is no ſuch will of God for us to ſubmit to: God would not have any Man to ſubmit to it, to be for ever left an Enemy, or a Reprobate from God. God would not have any Man content to be Damned. Indeed, the worſt of Sinners muſt be ſilent to God, though he Damn them for their ſins, and not charge God fooliſhly, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he is Righteous in Damning them; but they are not required to ſubmit or be contented to be Damned. The firſt grace, ſincerity in Grace is to be deſired abſolutely, but as to higher Degrees in Grace, the gifts of Grace, the means of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are to be deſired but only with ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Other good things muſt be deſired with ſubmiſſion and Moderation;</hi> thus all Temporal good things are to be deſired;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>With ſubmiſſion;</hi> We may and ought to deſire our Bodily Health, our Life, and our Proſpering in the World, but this muſt be put in (if it be the will of God, and for the honour of God;) And if it be the will of God to deny us, therein we muſt ſubmit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>With Moderation;</hi> We ſhould not deſire great things for our ſelves, nor any thing too earneſtly; we may ſeek outward good things, but with a great indifferency; we muſt not be greedy ſeekers. Greedineſs notes, 1. A deſire after much, 'tis not a little that will ſatisfie the greedy mind. 2. An eager Deſire, a greedy Appetite is a ravenous Appetite, which ſcarce any thing will ſatisfie or quench; and ſuch an Appetite we muſt not allow in our ſelves after theſe Temporal things.</p>
            <p>We muſt deſire an increaſe of Grace, yea, and of the gifts of Grace, <hi>Earneſtly,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.31. <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts;</hi> we muſt not be content with a little Grace; though we muſt ſubmit to Gods diſpenſation, we muſt not ſo ſubmit to be of little Faith, as not to ſeek, and ſeek ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for an increaſe; yet ſo far we muſt ſubmit, as to be without murmuring, yea and to be thankful for that little we have. Reach forth to the things that are before, preſs hard on towards the Mark; be zealous in contending for the

Let your eye be upon getting up to the higheſt form of Chriſtians, ſo as to excell and ſhine forth moſt gloriouſly in the Grace of God; but if notwithſtanding all your endeavours, you ſtill fall ſhort, and it continue to be low with you, murmur not at God: Blame your ſelves that you have no more, there's the fault, you are not ſtraitned in the Lord but in your own Bowels, in your own narrow Hearts; yet ſtill, as little as you have, be thankful that there is ſomething of the Grace of God in you; if ye be ſome of the loweſt of the Servants of the Lord, yet bleſs him that you are his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſtill contending and that earneſtly to riſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe more and more.</p>
            <p>This increaſe of Grace, and of the gifts of Grace, is to be deſired with ſubmiſſion, but yet earneſtly; but in ſeeking after Temporal good things, there muſt be not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but great Moderation; we muſt neither ſeek much of them, nor be over eager in our deſiring of them.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, will follow theſe Three Directions for governing your deſires.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Quicken and enlarge your deſires after God and the good things above, and deſire them as much as you ſhould.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Curb and limit your deſires after the good things below, and deſire them no more than you ſhould.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Cruſh and crucifie your deſires after the Evil and hurtful things below, and deſire them not at all.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Quicken and enlarge your deſires after God and the good things above, and deſire them as much as you ſhould.</hi> Fear not tranſgreſſing in the exceſs; you can't deſire God or his Grace too much; enlarge your deſires.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Deſire to have as much as you can.</hi> Deſire as much of God, as much Grace as poſſible; ſeek great things for your ſelves here; the more of God you can get, the more bleſſed are you; and the more Grace you have, the more of God you have. Deſire to abound and excell in the Grace of God; get as much Likeneſs to God, as much Love to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48705:82"/>
God, as much Faith in God, as much ſence of the Love, and Goodneſs and Kindneſs of God, as your Hearts can hold. The Apoſtle prays for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Chap. 1.9. <hi>That they might be filled with the Knowledge of God, in all Wiſdom and Spiritual underſtanding,</hi> and Verſ. 11. <hi>Strengthned with all Might, according to his glorious Power.</hi> What is his deſire for them, let be your deſires for your ſelves; that you may be filled with the Knowledge and Grace of God, that you may be as full of God, as Sinners are full of the Devil; that you may be as full of Love, as Sinners are of Luſt; that you may be as full of Holineſs, as they are of Wickedneſs. Sinners are full of ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.10. <hi>O thou full of all ſubtilty and guile:</hi> The Devil fills their Hearts, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. <hi>Why hath Sathan filled your Hearts?</hi> Get your Hearts to be emptied of the Devils fulneſs, and to be filled with all the fulneſs of God. Let this be your deſire, Chriſtians, not to have ſomething of God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the grace of God; let not a little content you; ſeek to have all grace to abound in you; let this be your Ambition, to get up to be the beſt of Chriſtians, the chiefeſt of Saints, the leaſt and loweſt in your own eſteems, but the higheſt in the grace of God; ſeek as much grace as poſſible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Deſire God and his Grace with as much earneſtneſs and intention of Soul as poſſible.</hi> Let your deſires be large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and let them be ardent deſires; let your Hearts burn in Love, and burn in Holy deſires after God; let this be the one thing you deſire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that I may dwell in the Houſe of the Lord, and behold the beauty of the Lord;</hi> here Note, 1. God and all the things of God are but one thing, and our deſire after all theſe, is our deſiring but one thing; In deſiring God, we deſire the grace of God, and the means of grace, and the delights and comforts of God; and our deſiring of grace and the things of God, is our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring God; to deſire God and to deſire grace is one and the ſame thing. 2. The Saints deſiring after God and his grace, are ſtrong deſires; the fixing of the deſires upon one thing, notes the intention of our deſires; when the whole Stream runs in one Channnel, and towards one point, it runs more ſtrongly; when the Heart is divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt many things, God hath ſomething of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and the World alſo hath its part and ſhare
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48705:83"/>
with God, its Motions are the more weakly towards him.</p>
            <p>O ſtir up and quicken your deſires after God, and that they may be quickned into the more ſtrong deſires, unite them, let all your deſires be after this one thing, the grace and good will of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, let me aſk you, What would you have? What is it you deſire? O let the Lord be my God; let me have grace from the Lord; but what of God, how much of the grace of God would content you? It may be ſome of you would anſwer, O! if it were never ſo little; if I could have Faith, though it were but as a grain of Muſtard-Seed; if I could get any thing of God in my Heart, if by the grace of God in me, this Heart of mine might be but as a bruiſed Reed, and ſmoaking Flax, if I might get any thing that God would not deſpiſe, this ſhould ſatisfie me; 'Tis true, the leaſt degree of ſaving grace, the leaſt Beam of the Divine Light, the firſt ſpringing of the Life of God in us, the leaſt Spark of his Holy Image, our deſires ſhould be ſo far fixed on this, that nothing ſhort of this, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of the truth of Grace, ſhould in the leaſt ſuffice us; and we ſhould be thankful for the very firſt grace, if we ſhould never have any more, or riſe no higher. But are there not ſome that would have this, and care for no more; that bound and limit their deſires to the firſt and loweſt degrees of grace? This deſire is not the deſire of the Children of God; thou mayeſt go to Hell with ſuch deſires after God: he that deſires not to be perfectly Holy, is not ſincerely Holy.</p>
            <p>Do you deſire God? do you deſire grace? Stir up and enlarge your deſires; let thoſe narrow Hearts open their Mouths wide; be covetous Chriſtians, covet much, and covet earneſtly theſe beſt of gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts; ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> This one thing I deſire; nothing but God, nothing but grace, take Corn and Wine who will, take the Gold and the Silver who will, let the Lord God be mine, and that ſhall ſuffice me. Deſire God only, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after God fully, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63.8. <hi>My Soul fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth hard after thee.</hi> Friends, you have ſome Wiſhes, and ſome weaker deſires after the Lord, O quicken up theſe fainty Hearts; look oftner before you, how worthy the Lord is of all your deſires; what a Jewel, what a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the grace of God is; look oftner Heaven-ward, get a ſight of God and his glorious Treaſures, live more in the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48705:83"/>
Contemplation of his glory and goodneſs; it is the ſight of the Object that muſt kindle and quicken deſires; you that have cold Hearts Heaven-ward, 'tis a ſign your Eye is little in Heaven. Believe it, ſome clearer views of the Love, and Goodneſs, and Holineſs, and Kindneſs, and Glory of the Lord, would whet your Appetites, would put Life into thoſe dull Deſires, would make you hungry Souls, and thirſty Souls, and longing Souls; O look oftner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; dwell in the Mountain of Spices; get ſome Taſte and Reliſh of the goodneſs of God, by being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly converſant with him, and this will ſet abroach all your Veſſels, your Souls would ſtream forth in the Words and Sighs of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 42.1. <hi>As the Hart pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the Water Brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O God. My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Curb and limit your deſires after the good things below, and deſire them no more than you ſhould:</hi> particularly</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Deſire not over much of them.</hi> The beſt Food, the beſt Phyſick, if we take too much of it, becomes hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pernicious; when the Stomach is overcharged, and ſo when the Heart is overcharged, it ſurfets, and ſuffereth prejudice by what it hath received. That Prayer of <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> 30.8. ſhould be the deſire of Chriſtians, <hi>Feed me with Food convenient;</hi> a convenient Habitation, a competent Portion of theſe Earthly things ſhould be the Proportion of our deſires. O, if Men knew what were enough, and when they had enough, it would prevent the extravagancy of our deſires, <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.5. <hi>Seekeſt thou great things to thy ſelf? Seek them not.</hi> Thou canſt not bear great things; great Poſſeſſions are great Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Seek no greater things than thou canſt bear; a Ship that hath more than its Load, will ſink and drown. The Journey or Voyage of the Heart is upwards, you are Travelling Heaven-wards; this Earth, the more you have of it, preſſes you down-ward, and hinders your aſcending. O how much nearer Heaven might ſome of our Hearts have aſcended, how much nearer to God and Glory might we have gotten, had we not been clogged with the things of this Earth? Some Men are too Rich, and too Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in this World, to be Spiritually-minded. Great Eſtates bring great Cares, and encumbring Buſineſs, ſo that they cannot be at liberty, nor at leiſure to think on God,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48705:84"/>
or their Souls. Deſire only ſo much of the World, as is beſt for you; and that proportion is beſt for you, which will help you Heaven-ward, and leaſt hinder you; know what is a competency, and deſire no more. That's not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency which is enough to ſatisfie your Appetite; you will never ſay you have enough, if you will ſtay till your Appetite ſay, It is enough; this is like thoſe two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Horſe-Leach, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.15. that ſtill cry, <hi>Give, give;</hi> Get, get, and never ſay, It is enough. That is not a competency which will ſatisfie your Appetite, but that which will comfortably ſerve your neceſſities; know what is a competency, and deſire no more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Deſire them not over earneſtly;</hi> be not over hungry and greedy Souls; deſire but a competency, and deſire it but moderately; that you may not over-deſire theſe Earthly good things, do not over-prize them. Carry it towards the good things below, as Sinners carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, and the good things above; how do Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners carry it towards Chriſt? They make light of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. They ſee <hi>no beauty in him, that they ſhould deſire him.</hi> See as little beauty in the World, as Sinners ſee in Chriſt; make as light of the good things of the Earth as they do of the good things of Heaven, and then your deſires will be as cold after theſe things as theirs are after Chriſt; O if Chriſtians did deſire this Earth no more than Sinners deſire Heaven, how mortified would all their Earthly deſires be.</p>
            <p>Mortifie your inordinate deſires after the World; quench your thirſt after the good things thereof, or elſe theſe deſires will mortifie and quench your thirſt after God.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, you would fain love God more; it is your Affliction that your Affections to things above are ſo dull and ſo flat, that you have no more ſtrong and working deſires Heaven-ward; abate your deſires to things below, and then they will riſe more to the things above; never look to love God more than you do, till you love the World leſs than you do. Do ye mean to hold up at this height, in your Carnal deſires? Will you not ſet Bounds to your Earthly Appetites? Then count upon it, God is like to have little of your Hearts; of ſo great conſequence is the bounding and abating of your Worldly deſires, that if ever you would love, or deſire, or ſeeek
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48705:84"/>
God more than you do, you [muſt] ſtrike Sail, and drive on more moderately, and more mortifiedly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the World.</p>
            <p>Love this World leſs, and you will deſire it leſs; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it leſs, and you will ſeek it leſs; ſeek the World leſs, and you are like to be in good earneſt Seekers of God.</p>
            <p>Quench your thirſt, Friends, quench your thirſt after theſe ſtollen Waters: drink deep Draughts of the Water of Life, and you will no longer thirſt ſo after theſe puddle Waters, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt;</hi> that is, after theſe Carnal Things. You who have ſuch thirſty Souls after the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of your own Ciſterns, 'tis a ſign that you are little at the Fountain of Living Waters. Thou haſt not drank of the Rock of the Wilderneſs, who ſo luſteſt after the Rivers of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Chriſtians, dwell more at the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, drink of the Fountain, let out your deſires more after God; Taſte more of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt; let down your Pitchers into the Wells of Salvation, fetch in more of that Living-Water; lye more at the Breaſts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more the ſincere Milk of the Word, and ſuck in that Milk. Drink more of the Wine that is prepared in the Kingdom of God; my meaning is, live more with God, feed upon Chriſt, delight your ſelves more in God, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and ſatisfie your ſelves more in Communion with God, acquaint your ſelves more inwardly and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally with the ſweetneſs of Religion, and this will be the beſt way to quench your thirſt, and abate your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after theſe Carnal Things. Deſire them ſtill you may, and you will, as far forth as they are good for you, and as far as your Heavenly Father ſees them needful for you; but there will be an end of your greedy, and ravenous, and inſatiable deſires; if you deſire God as much as you ſhould, you will deſire the World no more than you ſhould.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Cruſh your deſires after the evil and hurtful things below, ſo as not to deſire them at all.</hi> The Pleaſures of Sin, and the Pomps and Pride of this Life, and the Gains of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, deſire them not at all. Theſe can never be good for you, and therefore are not to be deſired. It cannot be good to grow Rich by Fraud or Oppreſſion,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48705:85"/>
they are curſed Gains that come in that way; the Pompous Pride of the World, and the ſinful Sports and Pleaſures of the World, theſe are the Bane and Poyſon of Souls; a Cup of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not more Mortal to the Body than theſe Cups of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication or ſinful Pleaſures are to the Soul; and therefore deſires after theſe muſt not be limited or moderated, but be cruſhed and crucified. I told you before, of two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Government, <hi>a Spur, and a Curb:</hi> and the needfulneſs and uſe of theſe in the Government of your Deſires, you have ſeen in the two former Directions; the need of a Spur to quicken our deſires after God and his Grace; of a Curb, to reſtrain and limit our Deſires after the good things of the World; and now I ſhall tell you of a Third Inſtrument of Government, and that is a Croſs or a Gibbet, to Execute and Crucifie our Deſires after the Evils of the World: what Government can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Laws? And what are Laws without Penalties? And what are Penalties if there be no Execution? There muſt be Gallows and Gibbets ſet up to cut off Malefactors, or there's like to be but poor Government. The deſires after theſe Evil things of the World, are Malefactors that muſt be cut off and Crucified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14 <hi>I am Crucified to the World by the Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> that is, my ſinful Love of the World, my luſting after the World; thoſe three Worldly Luſts in ſpecial, <hi>the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life,</hi> theſe are all Crucified by the Croſs of Chriſt. Moderate your Deſires after theſe good things of the World, but kill your deſires after theſe Evil things. Doſt thou deſire the ſinful Pleaſures of the World? Art thou for a wanton or voluptuous Life? Doſt thou deſire the Gain of Unrighteouſneſs that comes in by Fraud or Oppreſſion, by ſhortning or detaining the Hire of thy poor Labourers? Art thou for growing Rich, by ſtraiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſtarving, or ruining thy poor Workmen? Doſt thou affect a Proud, or a Pompous Life? O Kill and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie all ſuch Deſires; Nail them to the Croſs; hang up theſe Malefactors; let there not be a Luſt left in thee after theſe wickedneſſes, but bring it forth to Execution; let there be no ſuch Deſires found alive in your Hearts. Leave it to the Epicures and Fornicators of the World to be Sons of Pleaſure; leave it to the Horſe-leaches of the Earth, to be Blood-Suckers, to thirſt after ſuch Gain
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48705:85"/>
as is wrung out of the Bowels of the Poor; leave it to the Butterflies, and Wantons of the World, to affect Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical and Pompous Gaudry; let Chriſtians know no ſuch Deſires, much leſs allow them, and foſter them, where they feel them working and riſing.</p>
            <p>And as I hinted to you but now, know that the two laſt Directions, <hi>Curb and Cruſh,</hi> will be eaſieſt to be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, if the firſt, <hi>quicken</hi> Deſires after God and Grace, be diligently proſecuted. And therefore here I in ſpecial exhort you to give all diligence, enlarge and whet your Appetites after God and the things above. Remember what I told you but now; acquaint your ſelves with God, live more in the Contemplation of God, live more in Communion with God, get you into the inſide of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; keep you cloſe by God, keep you near to Chriſt, let your deſire be to your Father, let your deſire be to your Huſband; be able to ſay with the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8, 9. <hi>The deſire of my Soul is to thy Name, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee, with my Soul have I deſired thee in the Night, yea, with my Spirit within me will I ſeek thee early;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lord, till you can delight in the Lord; delight your ſelves in the Lord, and then you will deſpiſe thoſe deſires of ſmall things that take up the Hearts of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. <hi>Shall I forſake my Fatneſs,</hi> ſaith the Olive-Tree? <hi>Shall I forſake my ſweetneſs,</hi> ſaith the Fig-Tree, <hi>and become King over the Trees? Judges</hi> 9.9, 11. Shall I forſake the Fatneſs of the Olive, the ſweetneſs of the Fig-Tree, and feed my Soul on theſe Brambles and wild Vines, which are the Luſts of Fooliſh Worldlings? <hi>He that hath drank Old Wine, will not deſire the New, for he ſaith the Old is better.</hi> God hath better things for you to deſire; better Wine, better Pleaſures, better Inheritances for you; O live ſo with God, live ſo upon Chriſt, that you may get you a Taſte of his better Wine, a Taſte of his ſweeter Pleaſures, a Taſte of the Fatneſs of Heaven, and then you will the more deſpiſe this Earth and the Fulneſs thereof.</p>
            <p>You now that are for Government in your Hearts, for the Government of your deſires, take this courſe for thus Governing of them; deſire God and the things above as much as you ſhould, deſire the good things below no more than you ſhould, deſire the evil things below not at all; get your deſires after Lawful things to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48705:86"/>
your deſires after ſinful things to be Crucified; put Wings to your Holy deſires, put Clogs and Fetters upon your Natural deſires, and up to the Croſs, to the Gibbet, with theſe ſinfull deſires; and herein have you ſet up the Lord to be the King in your Hearts, and brought your very Appetites to be ſubject to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>For our Joys;</hi> for the due raiſing and limiting of theſe, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Object of Joy, is the ſame with the Object of Love and Deſire.</hi> He that Loves, whatever it be, if he hath it not, he deſireth it, if he hath it he rejoiceth; he that loves God, if he can hear ſuch a Word from God, <hi>I am Thine,</hi> that's a joyful Word, then he can rejoice in God; he that loveth Money, or the gains of this World, if he hath it not, he deſireth it, if he hath it he rejoiceth; his Money is his Joy, his Eſtate is his Joy, ſuch a joy as 'tis, a poor flaſhy Joy, yet Joy there is to him. The Woman in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.9. that had loſt her piece of Silver, when She had found it, She calls her Neighbours together to rejoice with her; ſure ſuch a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man loved Money well. Joy ariſes,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Originally from its Object, or the Thing loved.</hi> It is God that is the Fountain of Divine Joy; thence it ſprings and comes in; therefore the Apoſtle prays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The God of Hope fill you with all Joy.</hi> There are Three wayes by which our Joy in God is raiſed. 1. <hi>By Contemplation:</hi> by Contempla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of God, we come to ſee and find out what matter of Joy there is in God; it brings the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and kindneſs, the ſatisfying and raviſhing Excellencies of God to our ſight; thoſe to whom the glorious Lord is as a <hi>barren Wilderneſs,</hi> or <hi>Land of Darkneſs,</hi> as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. it is either from their Ignorance, or their want of Contemplating of God. It is a ſign thou art a blind Soul, and knoweſt not God, or that thou art a Sranger to Divine Meditation: Thou lookeſt little Heaven-ward, thou doſt not ſend up thy Thoughts in ſearch for God, who yet ſayeſt, Where is that Joy? Where is that Bleſſedneſs? Where is that Joy? Look more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently in the Face of God, let thy Soul dwell in the Study and Contemplation of his infinite goodneſs; thou haſt a glaſs before thee, the glaſs of the Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his glory ſhineth, look more into that glaſs, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48705:86"/>
much upon what that Word revealeth of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of God, and then thou ſhalt ſee his Glory, and Taſte his Joy. 2. <hi>Expectation and Hope;</hi> therefore we Read of <hi>Rejoycing in Hope, Rom.</hi> 5.2. When Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath diſcovered the Bleſſedneſs that is in God, then Hope layes hold on it: this Bleſſedneſs may be mine, ſaith the Soul, and I have good Hope it may be mine, and in that Hope I joy. What Malefactor, that is in fear of Death for his Offences, that ſhould be told there is yet hope of thy Pardon, hope that thou mayeſt live, but would rejoyce in that Hope? What poor Man, that is in want, that ſhould have Tidings of a Rich Inheritance that was falling to him, but his Hope would make him to Sing for Joy? Doſt thou hear of the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt, of the Treaſures of everlaſting Joy, that that are in the Lord God, and haſt thou Hope that theſe will be thy Riches, and thy Treaſures? how canſt thou but rejoyce in Hope of the Glory of God? 3. <hi>Fruition,</hi> or the enjoying of the Object loved; and this is it which brings the fulleſt Joy; Fruition ſtands, 1. <hi>In our Actual Poſſeſſion of the Object;</hi> when we have what we hoped for and there is a double Poſſeſſion of God, that the Saints have in this Life: 1. <hi>A Poſſeſſion by Faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life;</hi> that is, he that believeth in Chriſt, hath Chriſt; his Faith puts him into Poſſeſſion, and from this, the Poſſeſſion of Faith, Joy followeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The God of Hope fill you with all Joy and Peace</hi> in believing. 2. <hi>A Poſſeſſion by Senſe;</hi> when we Taſte that the Lord is gracious, when we feel the comfortable refreſhings of his loving kindneſs; when the beams of his Light, and the Streamings of his Love, ſhine upon and warm our Hearts; when his Light <hi>Shines into our Darkneſs, and gives us the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. <hi>And when his Love is ſhed abroad into our Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt which he hath given us, Rom.</hi> 5.5. When we ſee how lovely the Lord is, and feel that he loveth us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the ſatisfaction of our Hearts with this Poſſeſſion;</hi> when we are pleaſed, and delighted, and ſatisfied with his goodneſs. A full ſatisfaction of the Heart will not be, till hereafter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>When I awake I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;</hi>

and therefore our fulneſs of Joy is reſerved till then; but ſatisfaction to ſuch a Degree there is upon our preſent Poſſeſſion, as gives us a kind of preſent Fruition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Joy ariſes, as from the Object, ſo immediately from the very Act of Loving.</hi> Joy ariſeth from love, 1. <hi>By way of immediate reſultancy;</hi> there is a great Pleaſure in Love; as there is bitterneſs in grief and ſorrow, ſo there is ſweetneſs in Love; this very Bloſſom of Love caſteth forth ſuch a fragrancy, as no Man knows but he that hath it. It is a Sweet and a Pleaſant thing to live ln the love of God. He that loves God, and feels that he loves him, and he hath him whom he loves, cannot but rejoice in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen ye love, and believing ye rejoice with Joy unſpeakable and full of glory:</hi> There we have, 1. A Chriſtians love to God, <hi>whom having not ſeen ye love.</hi> 2. His Poſſeſſion of what he loves, <hi>believing;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, is as I ſaid before, getting Poſſeſſion; and then 3. The Joy that followeth, <hi>ye rejoice, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By way of Reflection;</hi> when a Chriſtian upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of this his love to Chriſt, perceives that he loves him in ſincerity, this is to him a Token of Chriſt's love to him. Doſt thou ſee, doſt thou feel that thou loveſt Chriſt? This thy love to Chriſt is a Token that he hath ſent thee into thy Heart, to tell thee that he loveth thee. And when thine Heart can ſay, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine;</hi> the Lord is [my] God, [my] Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, [my] Portion and Inheritance, canſt thou ſay ſo? Then thou wilt add with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 16.6.9. <hi>The Lines are fallen to me in a Pleaſant Place, and I have a goodly Heritage, therefore mine Heart is glad, and my Glory rejoiceth. Thou wilt ſhew me the path of Life; in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy Right hand there are Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is with Divine Joy, the Object whereof is God, ſo is it, in a poor and pittiful manner, with Earthly Joy, the Object whereof is the good things below: This Joy is raiſed from our Contemplating of Worldly things, and thoſe Carnal Delights they will yield, and thereby ſucking out ſuch Juice as they have, for our Carnal hearts to feed upon; by expectation and hope, that theſe things that we may get, get Money, get us Eſtates, and the comforts of them, and alſo by our Fruition of them, when we get them; our loving
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48705:87"/>
and taking the delight and contentment of them, and according to what we have of theſe things, and the Degree of our Love to them, ſuch is the joy that ariſeth to us from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I ſhall give you ſome Directions for the right raiſing and due limiting of your Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Rejoice in the Lord,</hi> and let your joy in the Lord, 1. <hi>Bear ſome Proportion,</hi> as much as thoſe narrow Hearts can reach to, to that fulneſs, and thoſe Everlaſting Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of infinite Love and Goodneſs which are in God for you. I could tell you ſomething of that ſatisfaction and reſt which your Souls ſhall one day enjoy in God, from the Word of God; and the Experiences of ſome of his Saints, will tell you much more; but when your Eyes ſhall come to ſee God, then you will ſay, That one half was not told me. If ſome drops of this Joy, let fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints here on Earth, have ſweetned all the Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> turned their Priſons into Pallaces, yea, their very Stakes and Gibbets into Triumphal Chariots; if a few drops of that Joy have been ſo ſweet, and ſo powerful, what will the Rivers of his Pleaſures be? As the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Theſe things I write,</hi> ſo theſe things I ſpeak, <hi>that your Joy may be full.</hi> Rejoice in the Lord, and let the Joy of the Lord be your Strength; let this Joy be the Strength of your Hearts, and the Strength or Top of all your Joyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let your Joy in God be raiſed,</hi> 1. <hi>From the Evidence of your Intereſt in God at preſent,</hi> from your ſincerity in the grace of God, and your Union with Chriſt. You muſt be in Chriſt 'ere ever you can rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus; what will it be to Joy in God, if God be none of yours? Satisfie not your ſelves with miſtaken Joyes. There is the Joy of the Hypocrite; ſome there are, who upon ſome light touches of the Word of God upon them, and ſome little change it makes, are all on a ſudden wrapt up into Extaſies of Joy; though ſtill they remain ſhort of the grace of God, yet they ſeem to be tranſported with the Joy of God; ſuch Joy often proves to be but as a Flaſh of Lightning, which comes in on a ſudden, and then vaniſheth into greater Darkneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 20.5. <hi>The Joy of the Hypocrite is but for a Moment;</hi> it comes on a ſudden, and in a great Flaſh, and on a ſudden it is gone again. The
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48705:88"/>
Joy of the Saints is not ſo ſudden, but it is laſting; it is not ſuch a glorious Flaſh, but is ſolid and ſubſtantial; like a deep River, that makes no great Noiſe, when the ſhallow Brooks make a greater Bubling.</p>
            <p>See that the Foundation of your Joy be laid in Peace, and the Foundation of your Peace be laid in Grace. Get an Intereſt in Chriſt, ſoundneſs of Heart towards God, and ſincerity of Love to Chriſt, ſee to it that you be his own, that you be not Hypocrites and Hangby's upon Chriſt, but his real Members and Hearty Diſciples. Thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceſt in God, thou rejoiceſt in Chriſt Jeſus, but art thou of the Circumciſion? Of a Circumciſed and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Heart. Doſt thou <hi>worſhip God in the Spirit,</hi> as the Apoſtles expreſſions are, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. Is thine Heart with the Lord? Doſt thou love him with thine Heart, and cleave to him with thine Heart, and ſerve him in thy Spirit, in thine Inwards, and all the Powers of thy Soul? If thou art of the Circumciſion, and thus worſhippeſt God in the Spirit, which are the Properties of ſincere Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, then thou mayeſt rejoice: Beware of truſting to the moſt Elevated Joyes, that you ſeem any of you to have felt in Religion, and the Exerciſes thereof; you may ſeem to have much of the Joy of God, who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Grace of God. Thou mayeſt carry ſuch Joyes with thee to the Grave, and they may drop down with thee into Hell, and be ſwallow'd up of everlaſting Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; <hi>judge not of your Religion by your Joyes, but judge of your Joyes by your ſoundneſs in Religion.</hi> See then that thou art gotten beyond an Hypocrite, before thou meddle with the Joy of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From your Hope of the Glory of God.</hi> Rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. Thou that art a real Chriſtian, it may be thou haſt little ſenſe of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion; thou goeſt heavily under thy Burthens, the Burthen of thy Corruption and Infirmities; thou liveſt much in the Dark, the Light of the Lord is within the vail, and thou canſt perceive but very ſmall glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of it; thou goeſt heavily on thy way, hungring and thirſting, and fearing and fainting, and mourning over thine uncomfortable condition; yet lift up the Hands that hang down; yea lift up your Heads, you diſconſolate ones; though the Light, and the Love, and the Comforts,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48705:88"/>
and the Kindneſſes of God be vailed from thine Eye, yet let thine Hope enter into that within the vail, <hi>Pſal</hi> 42.11. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? Why art thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within me?</hi> Why, how can it be otherwiſe? wherewithal may I be cheared and comforted? Why, <hi>Hope in God; Hope in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him who is the Light</hi>—</p>
            <p>Let theſe two Directions go both together. 1. Let the Foundation of Joy be laid in ſincerity of Grace; I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bid thee rejoice, till thou be perſwaded to be an Hearty Chriſtian. 2. Let your ſupply of the want of Joy in Senſe, be made up from the Joy of Hope: If thou art a Stranger to all preſent Joy, yet if thou art not a Stranger from Love, thou haſt this Hope to chear thee, that thou ſhalt verily ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From your Increaſes in the Grace of God.</hi> They are ordinarily the Stronger and more grown Chriſtians, who can ſincerely rejoice in God. Younger Chriſtians are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Mourners, and do but go on lamenting after God. It's true, there are ſome Young Converts, or that ſeem to be ſuch, whoſe Joyes meet them at the very entry of Chriſtianity; who at the very firſt being wrought upon, ſeem to be all in a Flame of Love and Joy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I remember the kindneſs of thy Youth, and the Love of thine Epouſals;</hi> who have a bright Morning of it, and a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fair Sun-riſing; 'twere well if it would hold; but after a while, Clouds gather, and it is darker with them at Noon, than it was in the Morning; their Joy ſinks, and their Love ſinks; Clouds of Corruption over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread both their Joyes and their Hopes. However it may be with ſome Beginners, (and it is never ſo well, as they think, if it do not hold) however it may be with ſome Beginners, yet <hi>ordinarily, they are only the grown Chriſtians, who are Partakers of ſolid ſubſtantial Joy;</hi> for a great part of their time it is as <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.7. <hi>It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light nor Dark with them, neither Night nor perfect Day, but in the Evening there ſhall be Light.</hi> In our firſt time, it muſt be ſaid only, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and joyful gladneſs for the upright in Heart;</hi> this Joy is ſown in Sorrows, and ſown in Tears, but as we grow up, what was ſown in our Infancy, breaks forth and ſhines in our Age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:48705:89"/>Friends, dote not too much on your Morning Infant Joyes, they may vaniſh into Darkneſs. It is the ſolid Joy of the grown Chriſtian, that is uſually the abiding Joy; therefore if you would not be put off with ſome ſhort fits of Joy, if you would have that ſtanding Joy which no Man can take from you, ſet your Hearts to it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the grace of God; be thriving Chriſtians, grow in Grace, and grow in the Knowledge of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and then your Joy ſhall abound and abide: Friends, you now go on drooping, and doubting, and fearing; you have many a ſad day of it, but would you ſee good dayes? would you have your Cloudy to become clearer Dayes? Would you have more Sun-ſhine upon your Hearts? Then get the Sun of Righteouſneſs to riſe higher in you. Miſty Mornings, as the Sun riſeth higher, the Miſts are diſpelled, and the Day groweth clear at Noon, which was ſo Dark in the Morning.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, how many Arguments have I uſed with you, to perſwade you to preſs on after an Increaſe in Grace, after a more Spiritual and Heavenly Frame of Heart and Life? What ſucceſs have former perſwaſions had? Are you grown? Are you improved? Or do you ſet your Hearts upon it? Are you reaching forward? or do you not contentedly keep at a ſtand, and ſeem to grow back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and loſe your former Life and Vigour? What ſhall I ſay to you? What may I do for you, to Nurſe you up to higher Statures? We live in a declining Age; every where there are ſad complaints, that Rel gion is at a ſtand, and growing to decay: How is it with you? Are there any lively Souls among you? Do you get ground, does your Light break forth? Do your ways, as the Path of the Juſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Shine more and more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the perfect Day?</hi> Friends, pray inquire, one by one, Is it thus with me? It it thus with me? If I might, but prevail with you, to ſet your Hearts to it, O what a <hi>Goſhen</hi> might we be, in compariſon of the Dark places of the Earth? Whileſt there is ſuch ſad Darkneſs in moſt places of the Land, yet, in this <hi>Goſhen</hi> there would be Light. O might we ſee more of the Light of Grace in you, we ſhould ſurely ſee much of the Light of Joy. If the Soul of Hearty Chriſtianity might gather more ſtrength within you, and bring forth more Fruit without; if you would tread upon this Earth, blow off theſe Aſhes, blow
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48705:89"/>
up the Coals, ſhake off this ſluggiſh ſleepineſs of Heart; if we could get theſe cold Hearts to be warmed once, would it not be a Joy and rejoycing to us? Be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, Friends, to ſet to ſowing more joy for your Selves. Whileſt Sinners are Sowing Tears for themſelves, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Lamentations, (this they do in their Carnal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments:) Carnal Mirth is but the Seed of Sorrow and Miſery; as Light is Sown for the Righteous Mourners, ſo Darkneſs is Sown for rejoicing Sinners, and their rejoicing is the Seed of that Darkneſs; and when they come to ſuffer everlaſting Miſery, they do then but Reap the Fruit of their ſinful Jollity: whileſt Sinners are Sowing Tears, let Chriſtians ſet to Sowing Joy to themſelves. Do what you can to make your laſt Days your beſt Days, and every Day brighter than other. Do not barely wiſh it were better, and hope for better, but work for better Days; deſire more earneſtly, pray more heartily, look more wiſhtly, and labour more painfully for a viſible and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible improving and advancing in the Power and Spirit of Religion and Godlineſs, and then your Hearts ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and your Joy ſhall no Man take from you.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I have but two Works to do among you all, whereunto I labour, and ſtrive with you in the Goſpel; but theſe two works I have to do; to fetch in thoſe that are without, and to fetch up thoſe that are within. Sinners, you that are yet without, without Chriſt, without the Covenant of God, that are yet in your Sins, in your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, in your Impenitence and hardneſs of Heart, Strangers from Chriſt, and Aliens from the Life of God, my work with you is, to Preach you into Chriſt; to Preach you in by Repentance; I travail in Birth with you, that Chriſt may be formed in you; might I prevail in this Work, might any more among this Company of poor Sinners of you, be brought to Repentance, and be Converted, O what Joy would there be in this, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. <hi>There's Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth,</hi> and there would be the Foundation of Joy laid in your own Hearts. Come Sinners, come to Chriſt, the Fountain of your Joy, and your Hopes; come and be humbled with Chriſt, and you ſhall be exalted with him; come and mourn with Chriſt, and you ſhall be comforted; come and Repent, and you ſhall alſo rejoice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:48705:90"/>But if I ſhould not proſper in this work, if Sinners ſhould continue to be hardned, and refuſe any more of them to come in; if I ſhould not fetch more in, yet let me fetch up thoſe that are within; you that are come in, come up higher. Stand not always at the Threſhold, content not your ſelves with the loweſt place; Friends, ſit up higher, aſcend, aſcend; aſcend in your Aims, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend in your Deſires, get to be better Chriſtians daily, more experienced Chriſtians, more mortified Chriſtians, more lively and Active and fruitful Chriſtians, and then look for it, you ſhall be more joyful Chriſtians; get you to be more ſtrong in the Lord, and the Joy of the Lord ſhall be your Strength.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rejoyce not in Iniquity.</hi> Charity doth not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtians muſt not rejoice in Iniquity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.6. Let not your ſin make you Merry; if it does, that which now makes you merry, will ſhortly make you mad, with anguiſh and indignation at your own folly. Merry Sinners are all Fools, and ſome of theſe Fools will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways laughing, but we muſt ſay with <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.2. <hi>I ſaid of</hi> ſuch <hi>laughter, thou art madneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rejoice not over much in any of the good things below;</hi> we may rejoice in our outward good things, <hi>James</hi> 1.9. <hi>Let the Brother of low degree, rejoice in that he is exalted;</hi> that is, let the Poor rejoice, when he is made Rich; Poverty is an Affliction, and Riches are a Mercy, and ſuch a Mercy as we may rejoice in. But though we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in every outward Mercy, yet we may not rejoice overmuch in them; particularly for the limits of this Joy, they muſt be ſuch as theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Joy not in any of theſe good things as if they were your happineſs;</hi> they may be Means to our happineſs, but muſt not be made the Matter of our happineſs; to make our Eſtates our happineſs, is to make them our God, and the way to make us miſerable; he is a miſerable Rich Man, who maketh his Riches his Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Joy not ſo much in them, as to rejoyce ever the leſs in God.</hi> You have ſo much need of God, in the greateſt Plenty and Proſperity, as you have when you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and you ſhould ſo much thirſt after the Joy of God in your greateſt Worldly Joy, as in your Sorrow. Take not your Worldly Joy in ſtead of Joy in God;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48705:90"/>
think not to ſupply your want of Joy in God, by the abounding of Worldly Joy. You may as well feed your Souls with Meat and Drink, you may as well provide for your Souls by your Money or Eſtates, as comfort them by that Joy that ariſeth out of theſe Earthly things. Souls muſt have a God, the Comfort of God, the Joy of God to refreſh them, and ſupport them; that Soul is a Carnal Soul, that can feed upon Carnal Joys; you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs need the Joy of God, for any Worldly Joy, and you muſt look to it, that your Worldly Joys be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to that height, as to leſſen your eſteem of the Joy of the Lord. The Joy of God will quench your thirſt after the World; and then the Joy of the World exceedeth it's Bounds, when it quencheth your thirſt after God, and the light of his Countenance. Thou art Rich, thou art full, and proſpereſt in the World, thy Bull gendreth and faileth not, thy Cow calveth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thy Oxen are ſtrong to labour, thy Sheep bring forth Thouſands, and ten Thouſands in the Streets; and now thou haſt Hearts Eaſe, and rejoyceſt in thy Portion; but how ſtandeſt thou now in reſpect to God? Is God ever the leſs need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Is God ever the leſs loved? Is the Joy of God ſtill thy chief Joy? Or doſt thou not even forget that thou haſt a God, or a Soul, and leave it to them that have nothing below to rejoyce in God that is above. What thinkeſt thou of thy ſelf? Hath this Earth eaten up Heaven? Hath the Joy of this Earth ſwallowed up the Joy of the Lord? Sure it hath tranſgreſſed its Bounds. It may be thou wilt ſay as the Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. and it is well if thou canſt ſay ſo, <hi>Although the Fig-Tree doth not Bloſſom;</hi> &amp;c—<hi>Yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, and Joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> When thou art Poor and in Want, and haſt nothing left thee in the World to comfort thine Heart in, then thou wilt look to the Lord, and he ſhall be thy Joy and thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; but how is it with thee when the Fig-Tree doth Bloſſom, when thou liveſt in the abundance of all things? Doſt thou then feel thou haſt as much need of a God? doſt thou then take as much Joy in God? canſt thou ſay of all here below, Theſe are miſerable Comforters, if God be not my Comfort; theſe are miſerable Pleaſures, if God be not my Joy? This is ſomething, and thus it ſhould be.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48705:91"/>3. <hi>Rejoice with Trembling.</hi> That's the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoice with Trembling;</hi> in alluſion to that, let me ſay, Seek the World with Fear, and rejoice in the World with Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; let fear be a Bridle to prevent the exceſs of your Worldly Joy. Fear, what ſhould we fear? Why fear, leſt you ſhould forget God; leſt that which is your Joy become your Snare, and turn you aſide from God; leſt your Joy in the World, ſhould prove Worldly Joy, and ſerve for nothing but to feed and heighten your Worldly Luſts; fear leſt this Joy of the World ſhould do the ſame by you, as ſometimes the Sorrows of the World do, which the Apoſtle ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>Worketh Death;</hi> fear leſt it kill your Souls; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that does more corrupt and endanger the Soul, than Carnal Mirth, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Rejoice O young Man in thy Youth,</hi> &amp;c. but what followeth? <hi>Know that for all theſe things, God will bring thee to Judgment;</hi> that is, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Theſe Joys drag the Soul to the Bar of Juſtice, and thence to Execution in the Fire. There is ſcarce any thing that does Ripen Men faſter for Ruin, than the Mirth of the World, <hi>Job</hi> 21.10, 11. <hi>Their Bull gendreth, and faileth not,</hi> there's the matter of their Joy; <hi>their Children Dance, they take the Timbrel and the Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ;</hi> there's the Meaſure and Expreſſion of their Joy; they are ſo lifted up, that they muſt have the Muſick, and their Dancing, to heighten their Mirth; but what's the end? In a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they go down to the Grave, and thence into the Bottomleſs Pit.</p>
            <p>O the Madneſs of this Merry World! That can ſee nothing in God to Joy them in, and yet can rejoice in a thing of nought; that undo themſelves by their own Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, their Joy and Mirth: Joy is the ſweeteſt Flower that grows in that Garden, the Heart of Man; and this Flower muſt be the Poyſon to kill them, and is never ſweet to them but when it growes up out of a Dung-hill, out of their Fleſhly Luſts. What Multitudes have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, and Died of their Carnal Mirth; and yet fooliſh Souls will never fear it, but this muſt be their only Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which leads to Hell; what do theſe Carnal Joys ſerve for, but to corrupt Men firſt, and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

Walk in the Light of your Fire—that's all the Light you have, it is all Dark to them from above, the Sun ſhines not, the Candle of the Lord gives them no light; God ſpeaks Terrour and Trouble to them, but they ſpeak Peace to themſelves; their own Joy and Mirth is all they have to comfort and chear them. 5. <hi>Sinners Light ſerves for nothing, but to Light them down to Darkneſs.</hi> Walk in your Light, <hi>this ſhall ye have of mine Hand, ye ſhall lie down in Sorrow.</hi> Sinners, how Light ſoever your Walk be, how Merry ſoever your Lives be, yet what is your lying down like to be? He is a Wiſe Man, that taketh care, that how uncomfortable or weary ſoever his Way and his Walk be, yet he may have a comfortable lying down. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Mark the Juſt Man, and behold the Perfect Man, the End

When theſe Merry dayes are over, what a Night am I like to have of it? When the Candles of your Worldly Proſperity are Burnt down, in what a ſtinking Snuff will they go out? What a ſtink will they be in your Noſtrils? When your Fires and your Sparks will Light you no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then they will burn you; your Mirth will burn you, your Pleaſures will burn you, your abuſed Proſperity, your Riches, your Money, your Plenty, and the Joy that you now take in them, will burn you, and they will burn to the bottom of Hell. Will you yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in theſe Carnal things? Rejoyce with Trembling; Tremble to think what the End of theſe things will be. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. <hi>In the midſt of Laughter the Heart is Sorrowful, and the End of this Mirth is heavineſs;</hi> if the former of theſe [in the midſt of Laughter the Heart is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] ſhould not be true, if you ſhould Laugh and rejoyce, and know no Sorrow, if it ſhould be with you as with thoſe Merry ones, <hi>Job</hi> 21.9. <hi>Their Houſes are far from Fear;</hi> and your Hearts ſhould be as far from Sorrow, as your Houſes from Fear; if you ſhould have all Sweet, and no Bitter; all Sun-ſhine, and no Clouds; if the firſt Part ſhould not be true upon you, if in the midſt of Laughter your Hearts ſhould not be ſorrowful; yet, the latter ſhall certainly be true, there ſhall be no avoiding of that; <hi>the End of your Mirth ſhall be heavineſs;</hi> Hold up while you will, maintain the Mirth

and the Jollity of your Hearts while you can, the End of this Mirth will be heavineſs; <hi>you ſhall lie down in Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinners, what will ye chooſe? What would a Wiſe Man chooſe? <hi>A Merry Life, or a Joyful Death?</hi> Which do ye think in your Judgments and Conſciences is the beſt choice, to Die in Peace, to Die in Joy, or to Die in Sorrow? How would you have it with you when you come to Die? Would you then find, that all your Sorrow is gone, and now your Joy is come? Or would you be forced then to ſay, Now farewel all my Mirth, I have ſeen my laſt of it, and henceforth nothing but Sorrow and Anguiſh for ever? Doſt thou not tremble to think, What if this ſhould be my Caſe? Know it for a Truth, there's no avoiding it; if you go on to live this Merry Jolly Life, this ſhall be thy End, thou muſt <hi>lie down in Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians, envy not the World's Mirth, nor let your Hearts luſt after it; you have other Joyes than their crackling Thorns will yield; you have your Sorrows while they have their Mirth, but you have this advantage of the World: 1. You have Joy in your Sorrows; as in the midſt of Laughter the Heart is ſad, ſo in the midſt of your Sorrows your Hearts may be Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 2. Your Sorrows ſhall End in Joy; this ſhall you have of the Hand of your God, you ſhall lie down in Peace; <hi>You that Sow in Tears, ſhall reap in Joy, Pſal.</hi> 126.6. Whileſt thoſe that Sow in Mirth, ſhall Reap in Tears; you that go on your Way weeping, whileſt they go on their Way Laughing: yet mark the End of both; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.13, 14. Behold, however it be now, behold how it ſhall be hereafter; How ſhall it be? <hi>My Servants ſhall Eat, but ye ſhall be Hungry; my Servants ſhall Drink, but ye ſhall be Thirſty; my Servants ſhall rejoyce, but ye ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; my Servants ſhall ſing for Joy of Heart, but
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48705:93"/>
ye ſhall cry for Sorrow of Heart, and ſhall howl for vexation of Spirit, and ye ſhall leave your Name for a Curſe to my choſen, for the Lord God ſhall ſlay thee.</hi> Now your Enemies Eat, and ſome of you are an Hungry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But think how it will be in the Day when the Scales be turned; when the Sinners Eating Days, and Drinking Days, and Jolly merry Dayes are over; and their Hungring Dayes, and howling Dayes overtake them; and you that now Hunger and are Sorrowful, ſhall Eat and Drink and be ſatisfied with the Joy of the Lord.</p>
            <p>O envy not, and meddle not with the ſinful Joyes of the World; theſe <hi>Strangers ſhall not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with your Joy, Prov.</hi> 14.10. Meddle you as little with theirs; let your God be your Joy; and if he give you any matters of rejoycing in this World, and allow you ſome Meaſures of Joy, even in theſe outward things, yet rejoyce with trembling; and let your Fear ſo moderate your Joy in theſe lower things, that you do not laſh out into that Carnal Mirth, the End where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is Heavineſs. Eſpecially, when the Matters of Worldly Joy increaſe upon you; you that grow Rich and Proſper in the World, that find the World ſmiling, and come crowding in upon you, that have even what your Hearts could wiſh, and then feel your Hearts to be tickled, and pleaſed and delighted in your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; then take heed, then fear leſt you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God and your Soul, and neglect and loſe the Joy of the Lord, and your care of pleaſing the Lord, in your abounding Worldly Joyes; and never count any ſuch Joyes lawful or ſafe for you, but ſuch as make you to love the Lord the more, and ſerve the Lord with more chearfulneſs and care. If you do not ſerve the Lord better and walk with God cloſer, and bring forth more of the Fruits of Holineſs and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48705:93"/>
Righteouſneſs, in more Spirituality and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs of mind; if you be not ſome way the better God-wards, and Heaven-wards, in the abundance of all things, than you could be, or than others are, in the want of all things, count that Proſperity greater cauſe of trembling, than of rejoycing to you.</p>

            <p>When we conſider what great things the Lord hath done for our Souls, how he hath Regenerated, reconciled and called us by his Grace, pulled us as Brands out of the Burning, and raiſed us as Worms out of the Dunghill, and made us ſit together with Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48705:94"/>

What have I done againſt him, who hath done ſo great things for me? What an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Wretch, what a ſinful, Polluted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful Creature am I? God hath loved me, God hath ſaved me, the Lord God is become my God, and herein I do and I will rejoyce; but woe is me, I have ſinned againſt the God of my Mercy, and therefore I will rejoyce with Mourning; whileſt I Joy in the Lord, I will weep over my ſinful unworthy and guilty Soul: Whileſt you ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>Come unto me all ye that fear the Lord, and I will tell you,</hi> tell you with Joy, tell you with Praiſe, <hi>what he hath done for my Soul;</hi> what a gracious God, what a Compaſſionate Merciful God I have found him to be to me; whileſt you ſay thus, Come, and I will tell you what God hath done for me, you muſt ſay alſo, Come, and I will tell you, tell you with ſhame, tell you with ſorrow, what my Soul hath done againſt God; O how vile have I been?

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not ſo as to forget the ſins that have been Conquered by us, that we may rejoyce in Triumph;</hi> the Victories that we have gotten over ſin, will be both an advance to our Joy in God,

and the Evidence of the ſincerity of that Joy. Thoſe that are ſtill in the Chains and Fetters of Luſt, in whom their Pride or their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, or their Frowardneſs, doth ſtill Lord it over them, and can yet rejoyce in God, it is to be doubted, that their Joy is falſe and fooliſh Joy; a Light of their own Sparks, and no Divine Sun-beam: fear that Joy and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon it, which will conſiſt with a Slavery to Luſt; as the Apoſtle ſayes concerning Death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. ſo ſhould we concerning Sin, <hi>Thanks be to God that hath given us the Victory;</hi> this is Matter of Praiſe, this is Matter of Joy. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Dead upon the Sea-Shore, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.30. then they Sang a Song of Joy and Praiſe. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. <hi>Rejoyce not that the Devils are ſubject to you;</hi> that is, that you have Power to caſt the Devils out of Poſſeſſed Bodies; Rejoyce not, that is, not ſo much in this, but <hi>rather rejoyce that your Names are written in Heaven;</hi> and that's the ſame with this, Rejoyce not that the Devils are caſt out by you, but that your ſins are Conquered by you. Victory over ſin is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Title to Glory; next to the Blood of the Lamb, the Blood of our mortified ſins is the beſt Ink to write our Names in the Book of Life.</p>
            <p>Rev. 3.12. <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Houſe of my God, and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, what have you done in your War againſt Sin? What work have you made with thoſe Luſts which War in your Members? Can you tell of any Conqueſt you have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? Where be the Perſons among you that can ſay, This Heart was once a Proud Heart, but now through the Grace of God, 'tis more
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48705:95"/>
humble; this Heart was once a froward Heart, but now through Mercy, it's become meek, the Lion is become a Lamb; this Heart was once a Covetous Heart, an Hungry greedy Heart, all Earth and Earthy, clogged and chained to this World by its Worldly Luſts; but now through Grace the Cloggs are knocked off, the Chain is broken, and my Soul is gotten looſe from this Earth, and can now deſpiſe it, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of God and the things above. Friends, have you any of you experiences of any ſuch Victories? Forget them not, keep them by you; and in the day of your rejoycing in God, let your Eye be upon theſe your Conqueſts of Sin, and this will be a means that your joy will be the more full; then will you Triumph in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> when with your Conquering Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you have your Enemies in Chains.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Not ſo as to forget the Sins that we are in danger of,</hi> but to <hi>rejoyce with trembling;</hi> we are ſtill in our Warfare, and how far forth ſoever we have Proſpered in it, we have Enemies ſtill before us, that we are in perpetual danger of; therefore as it is ſaid, let not him <hi>boaſt,</hi> ſo let not him <hi>rejoyce</hi> that's putting on his Armour, as if he were putting it off. The <hi>Canaanite</hi> is ſtill in the Land; ſin lies at the Door, and will be upon you, if you ſtand not upon your guard. Chriſtians muſt build up themſelves in their Holy joy, as the <hi>Jews</hi> built the Wall of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Nehem. 4.17. They muſt have <hi>a Trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in one Hand, and a Sword in the other;</hi> they muſt Build and Watch, Build and Fight; there is an evil Worm that is apt to grow out of our Joy, which will overthrow and devour it, and that is, <hi>Security,</hi> or ſecure Confidence. It was this that ſpoiled the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Joy, who was a better Man and a Wiſer than any of us; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6, 7. <hi>I ſaid in my Proſperity, I ſhould never
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48705:95"/>
be moved; thou Lord by thy favour haſt made my Mountain ſo ſtrong;</hi> but what follows? The very next Word is, <hi>Thou didſt hide thy Face, and I was troubled.</hi> Security opens the Door to Iniquity, and Iniquity will hide us from our Joy.</p>
            <p>It is Matter of Joy that we are <hi>at War</hi> with Sin, and have gotten any little Conqueſt, and have ſuch a Captain to lead us on; woe to them that are at Peace, or in a Truce with Sin, and have nothing to comfort them but only this, that there is a preſent Ceſſation of Arms, and they feel not the buffeting of Sathan againſt them; they will quickly feel the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits of that Truce: Stand to your Arms, ſtand upon your Guard; whileſt you are Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt deeply of your Waters of Joy, fear that Wormwood that Sin will caſt in, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter your Pleaſant Waters.</p>
            <p>That Joy which will conſiſt with a ſinful Life, is no Joy of God; the Joy of God is Holy Joy; and that Joy of God that leaves us ſecure and careleſs, is not like to be long liv'd. Do you rejoyce in God? As ever you would that Joy ſhould continue, take heed of Iniquity; you go in danger while you live; it is not ſo clear and bright with you now, but it may be all Cloudy and Stormy to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; if the Devil can but lead you out to Iniquity, he will quickly raiſe ſuch Storms, as will make you forget your joy: forget not this danger; if you do once but forget your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger two to one, but it preſently overtakes you and ſwallows you up.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, if ever you would live in ſettled ſolid Joy, you muſt alwayes have a tender Heart, and a tender Eye, that will quickly eſpy, and quickly be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48705:96"/>
ſtartled at the Invaſion of ſin. Be Watchful, be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hearted, and then your Hearts ſhall rejoyce; and if you would abide in Peace, never live out of Fear. Never live out of Fear, till you are gotten out of Danger, and out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you cannot be, till you are got to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Much leſs not ſo to rejoyce in the good things of [the Earth,]</hi> as to forget our Sins. Thou art a Rich Man, thou haſt a Confluence of all the kindneſſes that this Earth can do thee; the Sun ſhineth on thy Tabernacle, 'tis all fair Weather with thee; thou Proſpereſt in the World, and herein thou doſt rejoyce. But Man, thou art a Sinner all this while; Haſt thou not great guilt lying upon thee? Haſt thou not unconquered Luſts remaining in thee? Or doſt thou not go in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly danger of being turned aſide from God, and led out into Iniquity? If thine outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity make thee glad, yet let the Sin that lieth upon thy back, or at leaſt lyeth at the Door, make thee tremble, and ſo to tremble, as to be an allay to thy rejoycing; when with the Peacock, you ſpread abroad your Plumes, and lift up your Creſts, look down on your Black Feet; when you glitter in your Worldly Glory, behold the ſtain that is upon all your Glory; whatever fair Out-ſide you have, what an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide have you? Is there not Poverty within, whileſt there is ſuch Plenty without? What a Poor and Wretched and Blind and Naked Soul haſt thou, whileſt as to thine Outward Man thou art Rich and haſt need of nothing? Canſt thou in the midſt of thy Proſperity, forget thy ſinking and ſinful Soul? Canſt thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Soul, and will not this take thee a Button lower as to thy Carnal Joy? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the Soul, and the joy that grows up out of it, need not be abated in the leaſt by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48705:96"/>
the Poverty of the Outward Man; if thou be never ſo Poor, and afflicted without, yet an Holy Soul, an upright Heart, and the Joy of a good Conſcience, will make amends for all that; but will thine Outward Proſperity make amends for thine Inward Poverty? You with whom all things go well in this World, yet ſtill think on that Ruſt that's Eating out your Treaſure, think on that Moth that's fretting out your Garments, behold the ſtain that appears upon all your Beauty; the ſtain of Pride, the ſtain of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs and Carnality, the Moth of Envy and Contention, that's eating out your Hearts. Why ſhouldſt thou be ſad, would Carnal Comforts ſay? What haſt thou wanting to thee? What haſt thou to trouble thee? Thou haſt Houſes and Lands, and Money, and Health, and Friends; What wouldſt thou have? Why doſt thou not rejoyce and make Merry? Why? why, 'tis true all things go well with me without, I have a good Eſtate, and a good Trade, and a good Houſe, and am in good Health, but O what a Soul have I? O what a Wretched Heart have I? Do you aſk, What I have to trouble me? O I have Sin to trouble me, this Pride, and this Covetouſneſs, and this Guilt that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; God knows, I find enough to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, and to trouble me more than I am or can be troubled. Do you aſk me, What I want to make me merry? O I want God! I want Grace; I want more Faith, and more love to Chriſt; I want a better Heart; matters go not right between God and me; whatever I have for this World, O how little have I for the Eternal World! Can I be Merry and Jocund, whileſt ſin hath made ſuch waſts upon my Inward Man? Chriſtians, do but thus remember your Sins, and this will allay your Carnal Joyes. Art thou ſo Merry, that thou forgetteſt thy Sins? Take heed, the time cometh, when thy Sins
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48705:97"/>
ſhall appear and ſtare thee ſo in the Face, as to make thee forget all thy days of Mirth and Laughter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not ſo to rejoyce, as to forget our Brethrens Afflictions and Miſeries.</hi> It's well with thee, but how is it with thy poor Neighbours and Friends? How many are there that are in Penury, whileſt thou art in Plenty? How many are cloathed in Rags, whileſt thou ſhineſt in thy gorgeous Apparel? How many are ready to Starve, and Die for Hunger, whileſt thou haſt thy fulneſs of Bread and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things? Thou haſt enough, and thereupon rejoyceſt; but is it nothing to thee, that there are ſo many that would be glad of thy Crumbs, of thy Leavings, and cannot have them? Thy very Dogs, it may be, have many a better Bit, and Warmer Lodging, than ſome of thy poor Neighbours; is this nothing to thee? When thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf in thy Plenty, then remember thoſe for whom nothing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
            <p>Forget not in thy Joy how 'tis with thy poor Neighbours, much leſs how 'tis with the poor Church of God. <hi>Pſol.</hi> 137.5, 6. <hi>If I forget thee O</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>let my Right Hand forget her cunning;</hi> let me never touch the Harp more, or rejoice at the ſound of the Organ, if I forget poor <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> if I don't remember thee, <hi>Let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth;</hi> let me never ſing Song more, no nor never ſpeak Word more, if I preferr not <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above my chiefeſt Joy.

Doth the Church of Chriſt flouriſh? Is Religion and ſincere Chriſtianity countenanced and encouraged?

thy Tents O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and thy Tabernacles, O</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: But where is their Goodneſs? where is their Beauty?

Sun-burnt with Affliction, but Beautiful through Grace; but may it not now be ſaid, We are Black and Deformed; not only Sun-burnt, but Collied, Black as a Coal by Iniquity? Is there not only a Marring of our outward Beauty, but a failing of the very Spirit and inward Beauty of Chriſtianity? Though it were once ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13. <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, and her Cloathing of wrought Gold;</hi> muſt it now be ſaid, Our cloathing is in Sack-cloth, and we are become Black and Pale, and all Withering within? Is not Chriſtianity in moſt Places dead at the Heart? May there not an <hi>Ichabod</hi> be Named among us, The Glory, the inward Glory is departed from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It's well for us, if it be not thus with us, if the Pale Horſe hath not ridden into our very Inner-man, if there be not Death in our Hearts, if our Faith, and our Love, and our Holineſs, and our Zeal be not dead; if we be not grown ſtark Cold many of us, or at leaſt our higheſt pitch be not Lukewarmneſs. Conſider how 'tis with your ſelves; but if it be better with us, O that it were ſo, O that the Lord had not a Controverſie with us, even with us, for the loſs that we are at, and the fall that is to be ſeen among us; but if it were better with us in our Particulars than it is, yet forget not how it is abroad, with the generality of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors amongſt us. It is in every Bodies Mouth, what a general and lamentable Decay there is every where of the Soul of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtianity. And is all this nothing with you? Is this a Seaſon to rejoice and make Merry in? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.9, 10. <hi>A Sword, a Sword is ſharpned and is alſo furbiſhed, it is ſharpned that

What a Slaughter of the Faith, and the Hopes, and of the Graces, and the Comforts, of the Love, of the Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of the Meekneſs, of the Self-denial; what a Slaughter hath been made of all theſe already? How little of them is there left alive? Is there ſuch a Spiritual Sword, ſuch a Javelin ſmitten through the Heart, ſuch a ſore Slaughter made of the very Spirit of Religion, and ſhould we yet make Mirth?

            <p>Chriſtians, I doubt we have too much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten all this; we do not conſider, we do not remember or lay it to Heart, how ſadly it goeth with the Intereſt of Chriſtianity among us; ſure it would change many of our Countenances, and abate us our Pleaſant Hours, were this duly Weighed.</p>
            <p>It is our Fault and our Sin, that it is thus with us, and 'tis a ſign that thou art of the Number of thoſe ſick Souls, thou art one of them; there is a ſad Slaughter made in thine own Soul, [thine] Heart languiſheth, and thy Grace is whithered; 'tis a Sign it is ſo, if thou

The Attributes are his <hi>Glorious and Fearful Name,</hi> Deut. 28.58. <hi>That thou mayeſt Fear that Glorious and Fearful Name, the Lord thy God;</hi> this fear of God, is a <hi>Fear of Reverence;</hi> to Fear God, is to ſtand in aw of his Glorious Majeſty; but in ſpecial there muſt be a fear of the Indignation of God, and the Power of his Wrath. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.5. <hi>I will tell you what you ſhould fear, fear him who is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body;</hi> the fear of God, is the Ground and Reaſon of all other Fears.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sin is to be Feared,</hi> 2 Sam. 1.14. <hi>How waſt thou not afraid, to ſtretch forth thine Hand and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48705:99"/>
deſtroy the Lords Anointed?</hi> It was thy Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thy great Sin to do that Act; How is it that thou wert not afraid to do it? Sin is the moſt formidable of Evils; if Men knew what it were to Sin againſt God, 'twould make them tremble; not only great ſins, but little ſins, not only open, but the moſt ſecret ſins: there's enough in every ſin to make Men afraid; that Men are ſo vile, and ſo wicked as they are, it is becauſe they fear not ſin; fear ſin and you will fly from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Temptations to ſin are to be feared.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to pray, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation.</hi> It is our fear that muſt bring us on our Knees, to make this Hearty Prayer. If ſin be to be feared, then whatever enticeth or leadeth to ſin is to be feared. Some of our Temptations are to be <hi>feared and ſhunned;</hi> evil Companions are a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, theſe muſt be ſhunned; the liberty of unneceſſary Sports and Recreations, of ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Feaſtings, of curious and coſtly Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Temptations, and therefore muſt be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; others of our Temptations are to be <hi>feared and warily uſed:</hi> Riches and outward Proſperity is a Temptation; our Money, and our Lands, and our buſineſſes in the World are Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>He that will be Rich, falleth into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore muſt ſo be feared, as to make us the more wary and circumſpect in the ſeeking and uſing of them: follow your Trades with fear, go into your Fields and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets with fear, Eat and Drink with fear; fear your fine Houſes, fear you Plentiful and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Eſtates, leſt by theſe you be led away to ſin, and to forget God. You are every day among Temptations, throughout the whole time of your lives, and therefore is the Exhortation of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Paſs the time of your Sojourning here in fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:48705:99"/>4. <hi>The puniſhments of ſin are to be feared.</hi> The wrath and the curſe of God, that Everlaſting death which is the wages of ſin, as I told you before, <hi>fear him who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in Hell.</hi> He is able and he will do it, if thou continue in thy ſin. This fear is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart, as the Sword of the Angel was placed in the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> to keep him back from his wicked deſigns. This world is a wicked world; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God hath placed ſuch a flaming ſword in ſinners ways, notwithſtanding all their fears, how wilfully wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are they? but what world would this world be, if there were no fear upon mens hearts, to bridle or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We are to keep the heart out of fear of what it ſhould not fear,</hi> to ſuppreſs and keep down all unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſinful fears. There are two things eſpecially which men fear but ſhould not fear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Yoke of Chriſt;</hi> the difficulties and ſeverities of Religion; ſome men continue to be ſinners, becauſe they are afraid to be Saints; they continue under the power of the Devil, becauſe they are afraid of Chriſt. They look on Chriſt as an hard Maſter, his ſervice as hard ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, his Yoke as an hard Yoke; ſome deſires they have after Religion, they could wiſh themſelves Chriſtians, but they are afraid to venture. The difficulties and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of a Godly life keep them off; they are afraid of them, that they ſhall never bear them. As God placed a flaming ſword in <hi>Eden, Gen.</hi> 3. ſo theſe fears, are a flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſword of the devils placing, <hi>to keep the way of the tree of Life,</hi> to keep ſinners back from Chriſt; they dare not come to Chriſt, for fear of him, and the heavy yoke that he would put upon their Necks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſufferings of this Life.</hi> Theſe are not to be feared. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Fear none of thoſe things which you ſhall ſuffer.</hi> And this very charge, not to fear them, is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that even Chriſtians are too apt to fear Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Death for Chriſts ſake,</hi> Luke 12.4. <hi>Fear not them that kill the body.</hi> Fear not the worſt that men can do; You may not only be perſecuted by evil men, impriſoned, ſpoiled of your Goods, but you may be ſlain, put to death by them; yet fear them not; and as a violent death, a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48705:100"/>
being put to death for Chriſt, ſo neither is a natural death to be feared; death is <hi>the King of terrours.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. That <hi>for fear of death, men are all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi> There is a <hi>natural fear</hi> of death, implanted in every man, even in Chriſt himſelf, and there is a <hi>ſinful fear</hi> of death; and then 'tis ſinful, when 'tis exceſſive; when there is ſo great a fear of death, as to diſtreſs, and diſtract us in the duties of our lives. When there is ſo great a fear of death, that we cannot quietly and patiently ſubmit to its ſtroke; when we cannot comfort and ſupport our ſelves againſt the fear of death, by the hope we have in our death; <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hath hope in his death,</hi> Prov. 14.32. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning ſorrow for the dead, 1 Theſ. 4.13. <hi>Sorrow not as men without hope,</hi> the ſame may be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fear of death, fear not as men without hope. The righteous hath hope in his death, he lies down in hope, goes to his grave in hope, and this hope fortifieth his heart under all its fears.</p>
            <p>Now friends would you keep your hearts under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, learn theſe two Leſſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Keep your hearts in fear,</hi> and particularly 1. <hi>keep you in the fear of God,</hi> keep up the Aw and Reverence of God in your hearts, get you trembling hearts before the Lord; behold the ſevere and jealous eye that is upon you, live under ſuch a deep ſenſe of the Greatneſs, Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the great God, as may conſtantly awe you. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Lord God in your hearts and let him be your fear and your dread.</hi> Thoſe that live not under an awe of God, lye open to the Devil and all his Temptations. It is this, the fear of God, that is the bridle, to keep us in due order.</p>
            <p n="2">2, <hi>Keep you in fear of ſinning againſt God.</hi> Pſal. 4.4. <hi>Tremble and ſin not.</hi> Art thou a profeſſor of faith in God, and doſt thou not yet fear to ſin againſt God? doſt thou believe that God is the obſerver of all ungodlineſs? that thine iniquities are all marked before him? doſt thou believe that God is the avenger of all ungodlineſs, and that all thine iniquities ſhall be recompenſed and returned upon thine own head? how is it then that thou art no more afraid of iniquity? Art thou an hypocritical profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and doth not thine hypocriſie make thee afraid? art thou a proud Profeſſor, or a worldly Profeſſor, or a luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, or froward, or carnal, or ſlothful Profeſſour, how
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48705:100"/>
is it that thy pride, thy covetouſneſs, that thy coldneſs, or frowardneſs, or carnality, or ſlothfulneſs doth not make thee afraid? are theſe Evils, this Pride, and this Hypocriſie, this Coveteouſneſs, this frowardneſs rooted and raigning in thy heart? where are thy fears all this while? call up fear, put on fear, and let this ſuppreſs theſe luſts, which will elſe be breaking forth into practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal iniquity. If you would fear a life of Covetouſneſs, a life of Pride, fear this heart of Pride, this worldly carnal heart; if you would fear a froward look, a froward tongue, fear a froward heart; cruſh this Cockatrice Egg, before it hatch into practical wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Fear Temptation to Sin.</hi> What does uſe to foment or heighten the luſts of thine heart? What doth uſe to draw them forth into practice? Whatever it be: fear it as you would fear the Devil. Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Fear whatever you over love in the World;</p>
            <p n="1">1. When you have your pleaſant diſhes before you, and varieties of them; when you have your pleaſant cups before you, fear your being tempted to exceſs; feed not your ſelves without fear, eſpecially feaſt not without fear; <hi>put a knife to thy throat if thou be given to appetite, when thou ſeeſt dainties before thee.</hi> Prov. 23.2. <hi>Look not on the wine when it is red in the cup and ſparkles, and moves it ſelf aright.</hi> Look beſides it, be afraid to look upon it, leſt it tempt thine appetite beyond its bounds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fear your fine Clothes; your Faſhions and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that you delight in; haſt thou not pride in thine heart, and is not thy pride even as tinder, that will catch fire of every ſpark; doſt thou love to be fine and gallant, doſt thou love thy fine Faſhions and Ornaments? let thy love make thee afraid.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fear that Money that thou loveſt, and thy Lands and thy Fields and the increaſe of thy Subſtance; <hi>when riches encreaſe ſet not your hearts upon them,</hi> Pſal. 62.10. Do you proſper, do you grow rich in this world, do ye feel the world coming in, and your ſubſtance increaſing upon you? fear this proſperity; I do not ſay, fear proſperity and ſhun it or flee from it, but fear it and look the better to your ſelves, be jealous of your ſelves in ſuch a time, leſt when you proſper and be full, you then forget God. Have an eye to your hearts in your proſperous eſtate; take heed that your Souls grow not poorer, as your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48705:101"/>
Man growes richer; It was the joy of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. That though his outward man grew to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, yet his inward man was renewed day by day; but friends let it be your fear, leſt as your outward man flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, your inward man grow to decay; leſt your Riches eat up your Religion; leſt you looſe your love to God, leſt you abate in your care for the things of Chriſt, leſt thoſe poor ſouls wither and ſuffer loſs, leſt the work of God be at a ſtand with you; leſt praying and praiſing and communing with your hearts, and looking into the other World, and caring and labouring for thoſe poor immortal Souls, be laid aſide or but ſlightly ſhuffled over. Know any of you that are in a proſperous eſtate, that have ſet your hearts upon getting and find the world increaſing upon you, know that you are in danger; your Souls are in danger, your Religion is in danger of ſinking and withering; your Proſperity is a temptation that will endanger your neglect of God and your Souls. Look upon proſperity as a temptation, and fear it as a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; be jealous of your hearts in ſuch a time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fear your vain Company, your Societies, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies with your carnal Friends and acquaintance. Doſt thou love vain company? I do not ſpeak of vile company, of Drunkards, and Rioters, of Swearers, and Scoffers at Godlineſs, thoſe Sons of Debauchery that are the filth and garbage of the VVorld, but even vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that are nothing but froth and folly, complement and merriment; the unſavoury ſalt of the earth, that are good for nothing; to whom a ſerious and ſavoury word put in, is as <hi>vinegar to the teeth, and as ſmoke to the eyes;</hi> and who will thereby tempt you, to turn out all religion out of doors, for the time at leaſt; becauſe 'tis ſo unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury to the Company. Fear to come among them, go not out after them, thruſt not your ſelves unneceſſarily in among them; but when God brings you in among ſuch, when neceſſary buſineſs brings you in, be with them in fear; think with your ſelves, now I muſt look to mine heart, here be they that are like elſe to ſteal it away from God. Friends, ſettle this upon your hearts, and really believe it, and carry the ſenſe of it upon you, that <hi>vain acquaintance and companions are a temptation.</hi> Though they do not tempt you to drunkenneſs, or ſwearing or lying or riot, yet they may tempt you to lukewarmneſs and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48705:101"/>
indifferency in Religion; they will chill and cool your good affections, and dull and blunt the edge of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits heaven-ward. As holy and lively ſociety, will quicken and whet our hearts, towards what is good, even as <hi>iron ſharpneth iron.</hi> Prov. 27.17. So are we like to be dulled, and blunted by vain company. Friends, would you keep your hearts in good plight? would you keep you clear of the vanities and follies of the world? would you keep your ſelves unſpotted from the world? would you ſhine as lights in the world and be a rebuke to their ſins, do you in good earneſt deſign to maintain the life of God within you? then beware of theſe ſons of Vanity and let them henceforth be your fear, and not your deſire or delight.</p>
            <p>To this, let me farther add by the way, are vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Temptations, and to be feared? then you that are Chriſtians, look to it that you be not of ſuch a vain, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, frothy Converſation, that we muſt warn others that are better, to take heed of you, and be afraid of coming into your company. If vain company be a Temptation, then take heed that you be not ſuch, that even your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſhould be feared. Such a fault there is among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and it is a greivous thing to conſider what a vain, and unſavoury, and unprofitable converſation there uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is of Chiſtians with Chriſtians, of Profeſſors with Profeſſors. What is your diſcourſe? how do you uſe to ſpend your time when you come together? how little of God, of Chriſt, of the ſtate of your Souls, is to be heard among you? you can talk of your Trades, of your Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of News; and ſometimes that which is worſe, tell evil ſtories of others behind their backs; You can laugh and be merry with carnal Mirth, even as others; but what do you more than others? whoſe hearts do uſe to be warned or refreſhed by your lips? Its ſaid, Prov. 10.11. <hi>The mouth of the righteous is a well of life,</hi> And ver. 21. <hi>The lips of the righteous feed many.</hi> Is it ſo with us? what of the water of life is there, proceeding out of thoſe Wells of life? If there be a Fountain in you, is it not a Fountain encloſed, a Well ſhut up? who are there whoſe Souls are fed from your lips? If Chriſtians did meet with no better feeding, then they have from ſome Profeſſors lips, they might ſtarve and periſh; So jejune and unſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid our diſcourſes uſually are, and withal ſo carnal and vain, that we rather pull down then build up, we rather
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48705:102"/>
chill and damp, then quicken and enliven thoſe that are converſant with us. <hi>We have too often,</hi> like the Quakers, <hi>our ſilent meetings, as to any thing of God that is going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</hi> Friends conſider, look back and obſerve how it has been; have your mouths been wells of Life? doth there not ſometimes come forth mudd, inſtead of water? have your lips fed many? May be your hands have fed poor hungry bodies; may be they have had of your bread and of your money, but what have they had from your lips? Not a word. Their Souls may periſh, for all the feeding that they have had from your lips. It is ſaid, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>Thoſe that feared God ſpake often one to another;</hi> that is, of the things of God; but is it ſo with us? what ſhall we ſay to ſinners, who when we charge others to take heed of their company, who will reply, why, they were even as good come amongſt us as amongſt ſome of your ſelves, and as much they are like to get, and as little harm by us as by you?</p>
            <p>Friends, I have more than once provoked you to be more Spiritual, and more Heavenly in your Converſes; but what hath been the fruit? Is it better then it hath been? O that you could tell me it was! I thank God it is a little better; I have ſet mine heart upon it, I have put my ſelf to it, to bring forth ſomething of what I have learned for others benefit. I muſt tell you, this unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs is an ill ſign as to your ſelves, as well as it may be a ſnare to others; barren lips are a ſign of barren hearts; 'tis to be feared there is not ſo much of Chriſt within you, when there is ſo little coming forth, that there is but little truth in your hearts, when there is ſo little Grace in your lips. O Friends, that you would yet check your ſelves for this neglect, that you would yet charge it upon your hearts, to be more fruitful this way. To what purpoſe are you preach'd unto, to what purpoſe do I warn you, if you will not amend? I'le tell you one way to help it, Let your own hearts be more ſet upon God, get more ſpiritual ſavour, more life and power of holineſs in your own ſpirits, and it will find an eaſier vent; More <hi>divine Communion,</hi> will be the beſt help to more <hi>holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> But this by the way.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>For our Grief or Sorrow.</hi> I ſhall ſhew here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Object of our Sorrow is evil.</hi> The Evils we are to greive for are,
<list>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:48705:102"/>
                  <item>1. <hi>Sin.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Miſery or Affliction.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What are the due degrees, and just limits of our Grief,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sin;</hi> This is the great and ſpecial object of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſorrow for Sin is the beſt and moſt neceſſary of ſorrows. Sin is a grievous evil, and it moſt calls for grief of heart. He loves neither God nor himſelf, that grieves not for ſin; Sin is the abuſe of God, and the wrong of our own Souls. How canſt thou ſay thou lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt God, if thou canſt abuſe him, or ſee him abuſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſorrow? how canſt thou ſay, thou loveſt thy ſelf, when thou canſt wrong thy ſelf, and not be grieved? what wilt thou grieve for, if not for that, which is ſo provoking to God, and ſo diſtructive to thy ſelf?</p>
            <p>Sin ſeems good in the eyes of ſinners, and therefore it ſeldom troubles them; 'tis that which pleaſeth them, and ſuits with their tempers; 'tis that which profits them, and brings them in all their gains; Sinners, that muſt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter die for their ſins, do at preſent live by their ſins; they are beholding to their ſins for their livelihood. Some men live by lying, and ſtealing, and defrauding; by Coveteouſneſs and oppreſſion; 'tis that which brings them in their Eſtates; they had been, ſome of them, but poor men, if their ſin had not gotten them Eſtates. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers live by their Pleaſures, and carnal merriments; 'tis their mirth and their pleaſure that keeps them alive, Sorrow and Melancholy they think, would kill their hearts. Sinners live upon their ſins, and therefore will not be grieved at them.</p>
            <p>But though thou thinkeſt thou liveſt by thy ſins, thou muſt die for thy ſins; thy ſins are making a grave for thee, and carrying thee to it; thy ſins are preparing an Hell for thee, and leading thee down to the chambers of Death. Thy ſin ſpoils thee at preſent of all that is good, and makes thee good for nothing, but to be fuel for the fire. Holineſs prepares the Saints, and makes them <hi>meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light;</hi> Col. 1.12. and ſin prepares ſinners, and makes them meet for the inheritance of everlaſting darkneſs; fit to ſerve none but the Devil, fit to dwell with none but the Devil. Sinners, you that go on in your ſins, you are herein, but fitting and preparing you for the Devil. This Pride that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48705:103"/>
you live in, theſe Pleaſures that you live in, this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs that you live in, by all theſe, the Devil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring you for Hell. There is a fire prepared for you, Mat. 25.41. <hi>Everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels;</hi> there is an Hell prepared for you, and your ſin is as faſt as it can, preparing you for that place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Your going on in your ſin is your ripening for wrath; thou art almoſt ripe already, and art ripening every day; and as ſoon as thy ſin hath but made thee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ripe, thou droppeſt as ripe fruit uſes to do, down thou droppeſt to rottenneſs, into the grave, and into the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the pit. Thou art grown to that height in ſin, that thou mayſt be ripe before to morrow, and as ſoon as thou art ripe, thou wilt be rotting; thy Body in the dirt, thy Soul in Hell. This is the fruit that ſinners get, and ſhall get at laſt by their ſins. Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> But yet, becauſe at preſent they live by their ſins; their ſins make them merry, their ſins make them Rich, they get money by them, they get Eſtates by them, therefore they are not troubled; though they ſin they will not ſorrow. <hi>Thou haſt ſmitten them but they have not grieved,</hi> Jer. 5.3. 'Tis ſaid, with reſpect to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinners, and it might be ſaid concerning them, they have ſmitten themſelves, and yet have not grieved.</p>
            <p>Sin ſeems good in the eyes of ſinners, and therefore it doth not trouble them; but ſin ſeems to be ſin to Saints. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. that is, the greateſt and worſt of Evils; for ſo ſin, when it appears to be ſin, doth appear to be the worſt of Evils; and therefore to them, its matter of Sorrow. When ſin appears to be <hi>exceeding ſinful,</hi> as the Apoſtles Expreſſion is before, then the heart will be exceeding ſorrowful; the degrees which by the right Government of the heart, this ſorrow for ſin is held up to, and the bounds and limits it is held within, are theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This ſorrow must be ſo great, as to anſwer the ends, and bring forth the proper fruits of it.</hi> The end of this ſorrow, and the fruits it muſt bring forth, the Apoſtle tells us 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. is Repentance. <hi>I rejoyced that ye ſorrowed unto Repentance.</hi> And ver. 11. <hi>This ſelf-ſame thing, that ye ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed after a godly manner, what carefulneſs it wrought in you! yea, what clearing of your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. What ever trouble for Sin, what ever ſorrow any of you have in your hearts, if it doth not bring forth Repentance, a forſaking
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48705:103"/>
and turning from ſin; if this ſorrow doth not work a fear of falling back into ſin, if it doth not work a care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting your fall, if it do not work to Indignation, and Zeal againſt Sin; if it leave you the Friends of ſin ſtill, the followers of ſin ſtill; if this be all you can ſay, I am troubled at it, but I cannot help it; it's my trouble that I am a Drunkard, it's my grief that I am a Worldling, or proud, or froward, but God be merciful to me, I can't get rid of theſe evils; if your ſorrow, whatever it be, doth not bring forth Fruit unto Repentance, it is not wrought up high enough; there muſt be more load layd on, there muſt be more of its Thorns, and Spears, and Stings thruſt into that hard Heart of thine; thou muſt feel more of its Gripes, it muſt fetch out more Groans, and Sighs, and Tears out of thee, thou muſt be brought to another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of trouble for ſin, then yet thou art, e're it reach the due degree of Godly ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſorrow must not be ſo great, as to hinder the exerciſe of any other Grace or Duty:</hi> 'tis ſeldom there is an errour in the exceſs; we don't uſe to ſorrow over much, no, no, we are apt to err in the defect; we do not uſually come up to ſufficient ſorrow; our hearts have but a light hurt upon them, our wounds, ordinarily are not deep enough; 'tis this which moſtly undoes us, we find our ſin to be too light a burthen, 'twere well if our hearts were more ſick, that we could find them bleeding inwardly, and bleeding more abundantly, as 'twas ſaid of falſe Teachers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.14. <hi>They heal the hurt of the Daughters of my People ſlightly.</hi> It is ſeldom that we can now a dayes, hear of ſuch a thing as a troubl'd Soul, and a wounded Spirit: We are, even Profeſſors of too whole and unbroken hearts; <hi>The Sacrifice of God is a broken</hi> heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. but how few ſuch Sacrifices are there any where found for the Lord? The work of the Miniſtry, God helps us, is ſeldome that more acceptable work, an healing work, to heal the wounded Soul, to bind up the broken heart, to comfort them that are caſt down; but the main of our work lyes, in making wounds, in pricking to the heart, in caſting down the high and hardned hearts; Is not there much of this work ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our hands, to be hammering, and humbling, and piercing your hearts through with Godly ſorrow? How few are there of you, who can truly ſay, I thank God, this work is done upon me; the breaking work, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48705:104"/>
work, the affrighting work is done upon me, my heart through Grace is brought low, and made ſoft, and made ſick of my ſins, ſo that I am prepared for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting work? That ſharp two edged Sword of the word, hath pierced ſo deep, and made ſuch work, ſuch wounds in my heart, that now the Oyl is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Balm to heal my wounds. O it is matter of trouble and ſadneſs of heart, to find no more ſuch ſad Souls, and ſorrow bitten hearts, then we can either ſee or hear of in the World. 'Tis ſeldom therefore I ſay, that there is too much of this ſorrow, that trouble for ſin riſeth too high; but yet ſometimes, and in ſome caſes it may be ſo; there may be an exceſs of ſorrow for ſin; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may be preſſed down over meaſure, they may be ſwallowed up of overmuch ſorrow; as the Apoſtle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and would have prevented, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Comfort ſuch an one, leſt perhaps he ſhould be ſwollowed up of overmuch ſorrow.</hi> Therefore in this caſe, there muſt be Limits ſet to our ſorrow; and it muſt be held within theſe Limits. It muſt be ſo much only, as may not hinder the exerciſe of other Graces and Duties; it muſt neither hinder our Hopes, nor hinder our Faith, nor our Love, no, nor our Joy in the Lord; It ſhould be with Chriſtians in this caſe, as with the Apoſtle in another caſe. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, yet alwaies rejoycing.</hi> Sorrowing, yet believing, ſorrowing yet hopeing, caſt down, yet comforted. It muſt not hinder our Duties. Some Chriſtians have been ſo overwhelmed with trouble, that they have not been able to hear, nor pray, nor think with any Comfort upon God, or the things of God. this is an exceſs of ſorrow, and muſt be reſtrained. Sorrow for ſin, no more then will help you to believe, and Hope and Love and praiſe and ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Affliction.</hi> This is another object of ſorrow. The Degrees and Limits of this are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That we ſorrow not ſo little, but that we have a due and a deep ſenſe of the hand of the Lord upon us.</hi> Otherwiſe we deſpiſe the chaſtning of the Lord, which the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Deſpiſe not thou the chastning of the Lord.</hi> By afflictions I mean here, the ſufferings of this Life; Croſſes and Loſſes of Eſtates, of Friends, Husband, Wife, Children, or near Relations. Sufferings in our perſons, by Sickneſſes, Pains, Languiſhing and the like, theſe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48705:104"/>
muſt be grieved for. God complaines, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.5. <hi>I have ſmitten them, but they have not grieved:</hi> 'Twas their ſin that they did not ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That we ſorrow not ſo much as to ſink under our ſorrows.</hi> That we be not ſwallowed up of overmuch ſorrow. As we may <hi>not</hi> ſlight or <hi>deſpiſe the chaſtnings of the Lord, ſo we may not faint when we are chastned.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. That <hi>worldly ſorrow,</hi> the ſorrows of worldly-men for their worldly croſſes, <hi>worketh Death.</hi> It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kills their Bodies, ſome men die of their griefs, but it often kills their Hearts, ſinks them in their Spirits, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifies them, and makes them fit for nothing. We may not be ſo depreſſed with ſorrows, but that we ſtill keep our Hearts alive, and to be of good courage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Not as men without hope.</hi> We muſt ſorrow for all our afflictions, but as the Apoſtle would have Chriſtians ſorrow for the dead. 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Sorrow not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as others, which have no hope.</hi> The Righteous hath hope in his Heart, and his hope muſt moderate his ſorrow. This ſad ſtate will not laſt alwaies; there's hope of an end of his afflictions, and that ſhould moderate his ſorrow; <hi>The Righteous hath hope in his Death. Prov.</hi> 14.32. and hath this double hope.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Death will put an end to his ſorrows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the end of his Sorrows ſhall be the beginning of Everlaſting Joyes, and in this hope he muſt comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under his ſufferings, and moderate his ſorrows for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Alwaies as men that have worſe matters to ſorrow for.</hi> The leaſt ſin is a worſe evil then the greateſt affliction, and calls for more of our ſorrow. Chriſtians muſt take heed that they do not looſe the ſenſe of ſin, in their exceſſive ſorrowing for affliction. When affliction lyes too heavy, ſin uſually lyes too light; <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.15. <hi>Why cryest thou for thine affliction—becauſe thy ſins were increaſed, I have done theſe things unto thee.</hi> Why art thou impatient under thy ſufferings? Whatſoever thou ſuffereſt, how hard ſoever it goes with thee in the World, there's a worſe thing then all this, that ſhould ſet thee a crying; thy ſin, thy ſin which is the root of all that which thou ſuffereſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Let your ſorrow for Affliction never be ſo great, as to hinder your ſorrow for ſin.</hi> Sorrow more for Iniquity, and that will limit and moderate your ſorrow for your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48705:105"/>
Why doſt thou take on ſo for loſſes in thine Eſtate, for thy loſt Friends and Relations? Thou haſt greater matters then theſe to trouble thy ſelf about; thy ſins are the loſſes of thy Soul. Think when thou art mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over thy worldly croſſes, as ſad as it is without, how is it with my Soul? Is there not ſin upon my Soul? Is there not Guilt upon my Soul? and let out thy ſorrows ſo much upon the ſin of thy Soul, that thou mayſt have none to waſt upon the ſufferings of thy Body. Reſtrain thy Tears for thy afflictions, thou wilt need them all to be ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine Iniquity. O Friends, if you were concerned for your Souls, as much as you ſhould, if you were ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the miſchiefs and miſeries that ſin is bringing upon your Souls, this would make all the ſufferings of this life, to be as light and little things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>For our anger.</hi> The Government of our anger is, that which eſpecially is meant, by ruling our Spirits, in thoſe two Scriptures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32. <hi>He that is ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is better then the mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, then he that taketh a City.</hi> Prov. 25.28. <hi>He that hath no rule over his own Spirit, is like a City that is broken down, and without walls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objects of Anger is Evil; the Limits of Anger are theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be never angry with God.</hi> Some perſons are ſo fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that none can pleaſe them, are apt to be angry with every one that hath to deal with them. There's no ſcaping their anger, but by ſhunning their Company, and having nothing to do with them. Men cannot pleaſe them, and God cannot pleaſe them; they will be angry with their Maker; when his Providences towards them are any thing croſs to their Humours, or their Intereſt, they are angry at God, angry at his Providences. So it was with <hi>Jonah,</hi> when God ſmote his Goard that he had given him for a ſhade. <hi>Jonah</hi> was in a pett, angry with God, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in his anger; I <hi>do well to be angry. Jon.</hi> 4.9. Some Fooliſh Perſons, if it be dry Weather when they would have it Rain, if foul Weather, when they would have it fair, they are angry; they frett, their Hearts riſe and murmur and repine againſt the Providence of God. And ſo when the wicked are exalted and flouriſh, and themſelves are oppreſſed and brought low; Men are apt to frett and murmur at Divine Providence, that thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48705:105"/>
it. Thence is that Caution, Pſal. 37.7. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him who proſpereth in his way;</hi> that is, fret not againſt God, becauſe of him, that he lets ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones to proſper. Let God alone in his way, whatever he doth in the world, keep ſilence to the Lord, and fret not, murmur not againſt him. To be angry with the Wind, or the Rain, or the Flouds, or the Sun, when we ſuffer prejudice by them; yea or to be angry with the irrational Creatures, that ſerve us; with our horſes, or oxen, or dogs, when they do amiſs, this is often anger againſt God. Some are ſuch Fools, that if their horſe ſtumbleth, or their Ox ſluggeth, or their dog barks, or takes what he ſhould not, they are ſuch fools as to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, irrational Creatures are not the Objects of your anger; you may ſtrike your Horſe, or goad your Ox, or beat your Dog, but hee's a fool that will be angry with them. Some are ſuch fretful fools that they'l fret and chafe at ſenſeleſs and inanimate creatures, which they uſe; how do Gameſters fret and chafe at their Cards, at their Dice, when they run not for them? how do ſome Tradeſmen fret at their work, when it fadges not aright; when their yarn breaks, when their cloth ſhrinks, when their Sythe or Knife will not cut, or cut their fingers, or their legs, or hit upon a ſtone, or the like; ſome ſuch there are, that will be angry with their work, will fret at their Sythe, or their Knife, or their Yarn, &amp;c. Theſe you may reckon amongſt the firſt-born of Fools; and the folly of ſuch anger is not the worſt that is in it, there's Prophaneſs in it too, anger againſt theſe creatures is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be not ſoon angry with men. He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the mighty,</hi> Prov. 16.32. Some perſons are ſo touchy, that 'tis hard to keep them quiet, like tinder or Gunpowder, that will catch fire of every ſpark; a wry word or look, nay their own jealous thoughts will ſet them on fire; every little thing will provoke them; this is an evil and ſore diſeaſe, that is hardly cured. You whoſe temper this is, know that it is your miſery; 'tis a miſerable temper, to be of ſuch a froppiſh touchy Spirit, you that are ſuch, you had need to pitty the caſes of thoſe that dwell with you. Look upon thy ſelf as a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar or a Thorn hedge; and know that the fault lies not in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48705:106"/>
them thou art angry with, but in thine own angry heart,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be not angry without a cauſe.</hi> Mat. 5.22. <hi>He that is angry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the Judgment.</hi> The only juſt cauſe of Anger is ſin. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Be angry and ſin not;</hi> and that you may do ſo, be only angry againſt ſin. We may be angry againſt wrongs, or abuſes againſt our ſelves, but it muſt be upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that theſe wrongs againſt our ſelves are ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. Be not angry without a cauſe, and be not angry for every little cauſe. Chriſtians muſt be patient, and bear much; it muſt be a great thing that muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to anger. Do not pick quarrels one againſt another, and make anger where there's no cauſe of anger; and do not quarrel for trifles, that any wiſe man would rather deſpiſe, then be provoked with.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Be not long angry.</hi> Eph. 4.26. <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath.</hi> Eccl. 7.9. <hi>Anger resteth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of fools.</hi> Of the ſeveral ſorts of tempers that are among men, ſome are <hi>ſoon angry and ſoon pacified.</hi> This, though it be an evil, yet its a more tolerable evil; let it not juſtifie you in your touchyneſs that your anger is quickly gone; to be ſoon angry is your ſin, though not ſo great, becauſe you are ſoon pleaſed. Do not allow your ſelves in this temper; little ſins muſt be carefully avoided.</p>
            <p>Others are <hi>ſlow to anger and ſwift to pacification.</hi> Hard to be provoked, eaſie to be pacified. This is the beſt of Tempers; this is that <hi>meek and quiet Spirit, which is of great price in the ſight of God.</hi> This man is a <hi>Moſes; Moſes</hi> could be angry and was angry to a great height, when he ſaw <hi>Iſrael</hi> become Idolaters; but yet this <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man upon earth. This meek temper is the moſt deſirable of all tempers, even for our own ſakes; every man that is a wiſe-man, would if it be poſſible be a meek man; none would be a fury but a Fool.</p>
            <p>Meekneſs of Spirit is the way to get every mans love and good opinion, and the way to our own eaſe and ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of heart. Frowardneſs and fretfulneſs is its own puniſhment; what vexations and galls are ſuch Perſons to their own hearts, and what a reproach, and a by-word and an odium are they to others?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:48705:106"/>Others are <hi>eaſily provoked and hardly pacified;</hi> a little ſpark will kindle a fire, but many waters will not quench it. <hi>A ſoft anſwer,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.1. <hi>turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way wrath.</hi> In ſome 'twill, but in others, neither ſoft nor hard words will do it; no contending, no ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no yielding, no loving obliging words or carriage will ſtop the current, till time hath a little allayed and worn it out. This is a wretched temper, and next to the worſt; ſoon angry and long angry.</p>
            <p>Others are <hi>ſoon angry and never pacified.</hi> The grudge of their hearts is a cancer in their breaſts; there it corrodes and frets, but will not be cured. Theſe are Devils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; 'tis the malice of the Devil that is implacable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. That's the 4th. limit, not long Angry.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Reſtrain the ſinful effects of Anger.</hi> Such as are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Angry looks,</hi> we read Prov. 25.23. of <hi>an angry countenance,</hi> an angry look is either a furious look, the fire of the heart ſparkling out at the eye, or a ſowre, and ſullen, a dogged or diſcontented look.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Angry words,</hi> as reproachful words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Racha, or thou fool,</hi> calling names, Liar, Theef, Varlet, Knave; or railing and bitter words, words dipped in Vinegar or Gall, ſpoken on purpoſe to irritate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Distances and Eſtrangements.</hi> Keeping aloof, refuſing ſociety with thoſe we are angry with; I'le do him no hurt, but I'le never have to do with him more, there's an angry reſolve. Never talk you are not angry, whilſt this fruit of it, diſtance and eſtrangement continues.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Revenge.</hi> When the grudge lyes burning within, and watching to do him an ill turn, or to be even with him, as they uſually expreſs it. Revenge is the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, endeavouring or doing hurt, to ſuch as offend us, to ſatisfie our malice and wrath. We may right our ſelves upon thoſe that abuſe and wrong us; either in our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, or our Names, in juſt and honeſt ways, and in ſuch caſes where God, or Conſcience; or the honour of Religion does not call upon us to ſuffer wrong, and paſs by or put up abuſes; we may right our ſelves in caſe of wrongs, but never out of Malice, to ſatisfie our wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts. Some wretched ſpirits there are, that in ſome trifling offences that are offered them, could paſs them by, but only for the ſatisfying their malice; their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48705:107"/>
wrath muſt be ſatisfied. This if it be a righting of thy ſelf, yet if that which puts thee upon it, be the malice of thy heart, this is a revengful righting of thy ſelf, how often do ſome men ſpeak at ſuch a rate, not ſo much that I do regard the thing, but I ſcorn to be abuſed.</p>
            <p>Well, theſe are the limits to bound your Anger. Be not angry with God, nor any of his Providences; be not ſinfully angry with men; not ſoon angry, not angry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe; not over angry where you have a cauſe; not long, not implacably angry; lay aſide an angry look, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain an angry tongue, and beware of meditating revenge, let not there be a ſecret grudge remaining which will make revenge ſweet to thee.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe this is a great peice of the Government of the heart, and of great difficulty, I ſhall direct you to ſome means for the bringing it about.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Prize, ſeek and maintain your peace with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This will find you other work to do, then to mind every little offence that comes athwart you. The wrath of God is as the roaring of a Lion. Whilſt you are in fear of that, or caring how to eſcape it, you will not mind the barking of a Dog, or the hiſſing of a Gooſe. What haſt thou nothing elſe to take up thy thoughts, then theſe trivial things? its an ill ſign; 'tis a ſign thou mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not God as thou ſhouldſt, nor thy ſoul as thou ſhouldſt, when thou art ſo apt to be in a pett at every little thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your breaking peace with men is your breaking peace with God. Art thou ſinfully angry with thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or with thy husband or thy Wife? take heed, God is angry with thee: Pſal. 18.26. <hi>With the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward.</hi> You that are given to frowardneſs, ſtudy that Scripture and tremble. Canſt thou ſtand before an angry God? wouldſt thou that God ſhould carry it as frowardly towards thee, as thou catrieſt it towards others? wouldſt thou ſee ſuch a frowning face, wouldſt thou hear ſuch words of fury from the Lord, againſt thy Soul? thou muſt look for no other from him, if thou carrieſt it thus frowardly to thy Friends. Mind your peace with God more, be more ſolicitous about the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up that deadly Controverſie, that hath been betwixt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48705:107"/>
him and thee; and prevent the raiſing of new quarrels with God, and then we ſhould have fewer quarrels one with another. Is it peace betwixt God and thy Soul? is all fair and friendly betwixt him and thee? methinks thou ſhouldſt bear any thing then from men; Is it not peace betwixt God and thee? Is that great work yet to do? Is there ſuch a weighty concern lying upon thee? Is thy Peace with God yet to make? What a fooliſh wretch art thou, to diſturb thy ſelf with theſe little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Totally eſpouſe the interest of God, and renounce the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of this Self and Fleſh.</hi> It is this ſelf, that is the make-bate, and the riſe of all our quarrels. If you would know no other intereſt but the intereſt of God, you would never be angry, but where you ſhould be angry, you would only be angry with ſin againſt God. If you had renounced your felfiſh and fleſhly intereſt, you would never take its part, nor take up the Cudgels on its ſide; all our carnal anger it is but our taking part with carnal ſelf; any thing that's ſpoken or done againſt thy ſelf, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger muſt be called up, to revenge this quarrel. Be more zealous for the intereſt of God, and theſe quarrels of ſelf would ceaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Know that a pettiſh angry diſpoſition (whilſt it remains unconquered) will make thee a briar and a thorn, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever company thou art in.</hi> Yea and 'twill make every one elſe, ſeem to be a briar and thorn to thee. What wouldſt thou have people ſay, there dwells a waſp or an hornet? there goes a briar or thorn? take heed how you come near him, leaſt you be ſcratch'd or ſtung? If you would not make every one elſe, to ſeem a briar and thorn or waſp to you, then kill this waſp in your own boſom. If people would but ſtudy more their own eaſe, and the calme of their own hearts, and to be freed from thoſe troubleſome boylings and burnings of their own Spirits they would prize and purſue a more meek and quiet ſpirit. Never expect freedom from vexations and perturbations, till you have conquered that vexatious Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Know that implacable anger marks thee out, for one whom God hath excluded from pardon.</hi> If there be any one perſon in the world, that hath ſo angred thee, that thou wilt not be pacified, that anger of thine, will certainly carry thee to hell. If you will not forgive you ſhall never
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48705:108"/>
be forgiven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.15. that's the word, your forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, is made the condition of Gods forgiving of you; your peace with others is made the condition of your peace with God. Thou that art an implacable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how dareſt thou ever take the Lords Prayer into thy mouth? how dareſt thou ſay, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us?</hi> there is this included in it, If I do not forgive all the World, let not God forgive me. Perhaps you will ſay, oh but I do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; I thank God I can ſay it with a clear Conſcience, I forgive all the World; and any Perſon or Perſons that I have had a particular quarrel againſt, I forgive them with all my heart. I ſhall never <hi>forget,</hi> but I do <hi>forgive.</hi> Oh what a folly and meer ſelf deluſion is this! I will forgive but I cannot forget; that is, I will forgive but I cannot forgive. It is the plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of, I cannot forget, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heartily forgive. I will do them no hurt, I will chide no more with them, but you muſt excuſe me if I carry a ſecret grudge in mine heart againſt them. Is this thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, thou canſt ſatisfie thy ſelf with? wouldſt thou that God ſhould ſay ſo to thee, I forgive thy wickedneſs but I will never forget it? Angry Soul, art thou reſolved to venture it, to go unpardoned to thy grave? would it not be a terrible word to thee, if God ſhould ſay to thee, I will never forget thine iniquities, nor blot them out of my book? wouldſt thou have thy name blotted out of Gods book? thy ſins muſt be blotted out or thy name blotted out. Wouldſt thou have thy ſins ſtand upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord againſt thee at the great Day? then at thy perill look to it, that thou quench this fire of implacable, anger.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Know that whilſt the effects of anger remain; the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of anger will ſinfully remain.</hi> Whilſt there are the fruits ſtill continuing, there the root is not cut up. Nay if there be but ſome of the fruit remaining; If thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear thy ſowre looks, and put off an angry countenance, yet if thy diſtance and ſtrangeneſs continues; If thou ſaieſt I will do them no hurt, but I will never have any more to do with them; if thou forbeareſt to give them provoking words to their faces, yet if thou continueſt to bite them on the back; takeſt thy liberty to cenſure them, to rip up the old ſores to others behind their backs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not thy ſelf, thine anger is not turned away,

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Spend more of your anger againſt your ſelves, for your own ſins, and then you will have the leſs to waſte upon others.</hi> That Counſel of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.5. is of uſe here; <hi>thou hypocrite first caſt out the beam out of thine own eye.</hi> Caſt thy firſt ſtone at thy ſelf; yea it may be thou mayeſt ſee reaſon, to ſpend all the ſtones thou haſt to throw, here upon thy ſelf and thine own ſins, and have none left to ſpare, to caſt at thy brother. How have I carried it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord? O how have I provoked, and do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the moſt high? O this proud heart of mine, O this peeviſh heart, O this envious hypocritical heart! Lord, what can I ſay for it? Lord, how can I bear ſuch a wretched deceitful provoking heart? can I bear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from others? Lord, how ſhall I bear it, that thou haſt been ſo oft provoked and diſhonoured by me? O my fooliſh Soul, thou haſt other quarrels that are fitter for thee to be engaged in; quarrel with thy ſelf, be angry with thy ſelf, thou haſt ſinned, thou haſt ſinned againſt God, and there let thine anger ſhoot all its darts. This would ſow up thy lips and put a bridle in thy mouth, as it did in Davids. Pſal. 39.2. <hi>I was dumb with ſilence,</hi> I <hi>held my peace.</hi> I had not a word to ſay, when I looked up to God. What if <hi>Michal</hi> mock, if <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe, God had a quarrel with me, and 'twas he opened their mouths againſt me, <hi>thou Lord didst it,</hi> and therefore I was dumb and had no more to ſay.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians remember all theſe things, and apply them every one of you, as far forth as your caſes need it. Do not ſay (as ſometimes ſome do) here ſuch or ſuch a one was ſtrook at, this word was directed to ſuch a man, or ſuch a woman; do not put it off ſo, but take it to thee, its a word ſent from God to thy ſelf, as far forth as thy caſe is concerned in it. Let every one of you reflect and caſt an eye upon your ſelves, and conſider how far forth you are guilty of ſinful anger; and then enquire as the Diſciples did in another caſe, <hi>Lord is it I?</hi> Lord am not I one of them thou haſt been preaching this word unto? See every one of you, how farr forth it may be your own Caſes, and accordingly accept of the warning, as ſent from God, on purpoſe to you; and ſo uſe the ſeveral means preſcribed, that if it be poſſible, you may hereby be enabled to get the Rule and the Government of your

own Souls. Remembring what I told you but now, from <hi>Solomon, He that ruleth his own Spirit, is better then he that taketh a City.</hi> If you can but get the rule of your own Spirits, its unſpeakably better to you, then if you had conquered all your adverſaries; if you can reſtrain your own anger, it will be more comfortable, and more tend to the enjoying your ſelves in peace, and ſweetneſs, then if you could ſo charm the whole world, that there ſhould never any one do any thing, that might offend or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you.</p>
            <p>And thus I have diſpatched what I have to ſay, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government of ſome of the Paſſions of the heart; to order and regulate them ſo, that we may love nothing but what we ſhould love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O what a bleſſed frame ſhould we be in, were we brought to this! 'tis true, it is not to be expected, that we ſhould be brought fully up to this frame, in this imperfect ſtate; but ſo much might be done towards it, as might make our whole way of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much more even and eaſie than it is. All our diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and failings do ariſe, from the inward diſorders and diſtempers of our hearts.

            <p>Now therefore, after theſe many words I have ſpoken, after theſe many days work that have been ſpent upon this ſubject, let me in the name of God ask you, what is there that hath been yet done upon you? what is there that hath been added to your holy love, to your holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and joys, fears and griefs? are there any little ſparkes added to you? do you love God a little more then you did? do you deſire after him a little more ſtrongly? are your fears of ſin, your fears of temptations to ſin, your grief and ſorrow for ſin, a little encreaſed? Is there any abatement of your love to the World, of your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires and joys? Is there any allay of your fretful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry paſſion? Who of you can ſay, I thank God, theſe words have not been ſpoken to me in vain. I thank God, I find this World taken down a little lower; I do not love it ſo well, nor deſire it ſo much, nor I hope ſhall ever again ſeek it ſo earneſtly, as I have done? are you any thing the more in fear of ſin, or greiv'd for ſin? are you in hope that your anger ſhall henceforth not be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48705:109"/>
without a cauſe, nor above or higher then its cauſe, nor ever laſt as it has uſed to do?</p>
            <p>Friends, conſider, in the name of God conſider; What, is there nothing done? are you as cold in your love to God, as hot in your love to the World, as much without fear and greif for ſin, as if none of all this had been ſpoken? The Lord be merciful to us, what ſhall become of ſuch hearing? What ſerves this Preaching for? what ſerves this hearing for? Doth God take pleaſure, or can you take comfort in your coming together to hear, and being a little affected with the word whilſt 'tis preaching, or ſpeaking ſome words after of your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and liking what you have heard, when yet the Word doth not work, nor leave any ſtanding and abiding impreſſions upon you? Its vain to commend a Sermon in words, if the fruit it brings forth commend it not. The beſt commendation of your food is by your eating it, and maintaining your health, and gathering ſtrength by it. O Friends, that's the commendation we would have of our preaching, and the only commendation that we can take comfort in, that our word reacheth its end; that there is ſome ſign of our miniſtry upon your hearts, and in your lives; that we may ſay concerning you, as the Apoſtle concerning the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> 2 Cor. 3.2.8. <hi>Ye are our Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and are declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, written not with ink, but with the ſpirit of the living God.</hi> Thoſe are the beſt Sermon Notes, that are written not with ink and paper, but by the Spirit of the living God, in the fleſhly tables of our hearts. Theſe are the beſt Sermon Notes and theſe are the beſt commendation of our preaching. Now pray friends conſider, I do not ask you what there is written of theſe Sermons in your note books, but what is there written of them in your hearts? Is there any thing more of the love of God, of deſires after God, of fear of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> written or begotten within you?</p>
            <p>Had I ability and opportunity of perſonal converſe with you, I ſhould be willing to deal with you in private, hand to hand, and to ask you theſe queſtions man by man; but to ſupply that defect of ſpeaking perſonally, and in private to each one of you, take what I ſpeak in my publick Miniſtry, as if it were ſpoken to thee in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and I were dealing with thee hand to hand. Though thou canſt not give (me) thine anſwer, yet
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48705:110"/>
fail not to give anſwer in thine own heart; when I ask thee whither thou haſt gotten any more love to God, any more deſires after God, any abatement of thy love to the World, any more fear of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anſwer thine own Conſcience in this particular. I muſt ſubſtitute thy Conſcience in my room, and let Conſcience take thine Anſwer. Speak every man of you i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beloved, I have preached to you in hope, I have hoped for fruit; I have hop'd for ſome change for the better upon you, in all theſe reſpects. O ſet your hearts unto all theſe words; remember what you can, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what you have forgotten; look up to God, look up to God, and pray this prayer to him, <hi>Lord let the things that have been ſpoken be written. Let them be written, not with ink and pen, but by the Spirit of the living God; not in a book or paper, but in the fleſhly table of mine heart.</hi> Look up to God for his help, and determine in your ſelves, to ſet your hearts to it, to follow after this bleſſed Order and Government of your hearts. Study within your ſelves, how to get up your affections to things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; to get looſe your hearts from the World; and things below; be not content to be thus dead in your hearts towards God, thus alive towards the World; nor be content to wiſh for more of the divine love, to wiſh you could abate towards this world, but in good earneſt, make it your buſineſs and ſtudy ſo to do. Might we once bring you to this, that while we are labouring with you in the Word and Doctrine, you would labour with us in the Lord, to work your hearts to an affectionate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with our words; if you would be <hi>ſtedfast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and abounding in this work,</hi> then there would be hope, that neither <hi>our labour nor yours ſhould be in vain in the Lord;</hi> then ſhould we look to ſee the death of theſe Worldly loues and luſts, and a ſpring of the divine love and life and joy and glory; this earth and fleſh under

foot, and the Spirit of Glory and of God reſting upon you.</p>
            <p>Put on therefore in the fear of the Lord, ſet you cloſe to this Heart-governing-work, quicken, ſtrengthen, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your hearts herein with theſe words. Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Government of the heart ſtands,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>In ſuppreſſing all manner of evil, and exciting and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the good that is in your hearts.</hi> There are in the heart, as there are in a Kingdom, two parties; the evil party and the good party: The evil party are the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Luſts of our hearts, the good party are the Graces of God. The Government of the Heart is to be as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Kingdom, for the ſuppreſſing the evil, and the encouraging and upholding the good.</p>
            <p>The evil Party are the luſts of the Heart; Pride, Envy, Malice, Covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there's no Government of theſe, but by keeping under and ſuppreſſing them, they cannot be kept in order, <hi>they are not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. but muſt be rooted out and Crucified. Thoſe that are Chriſts, <hi>muſt crucifie the fleſh with the Affections and Luſts.</hi> Gal. 5.24. Our buſineſs is, not barely to moderate them, but to kill them. Moderate Pride, or moderate Envy, or moderate malice, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Covetouſneſs, is not that which ſhould be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the Government of the heart, nor is there any ſuch thing poſſible, the leaſt degree of luſt is immoderate. As Chriſt determines the caſe about ſwearing, whether it be little or greater Oaths, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. 'Tis not, ſwear but a little, or but ſeldom, but <hi>ſwear not at all;</hi> ſuch muſt be the determination here, be not Proud at all, be not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious or Malicious or Covetous at all; to allow our ſelves to be moderately Proud, or Covetous, is all one, as to allow men to be moderate Drunkards, or moderate Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; this may be as well allowed, as moderate luſts. Moderate Luſts will caſt into intolerable fire. Poſſibly thy Hell may not be altogether as hot and ſcorching, whoſe Luſts are more tame, but yet it will be intolerable; It is poor comfort for any one to think, I ſhall have the eaſieſt place in Hell; He that is leaſt in the Kingdom of God, ſhall have his load of Everlaſting Glory; ſhall have as much joy and bleſſedneſs as his heart can hold, ſhall be full of the goodneſs and Glory of the Lord; and he that is leaſt in the Kingdom of darkneſs, ſhall have more then his load of the wrath of God; his heart ſhall be brim full, and running over; the fury of the Lord
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48705:111"/>
ſhall break the Backs and the Bones, and tear the Bowels; inexpreſſible Torment ſhall be given to the leaſt of the Damned Sinners. Moderate luſt, if it be not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified luſt, will caſt into intolerable Wrath and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; therefore theſe muſt not be ſuffered in the leaſt degree, but muſt be crucified and mortified.</p>
            <p>But how may I ſuppreſs theſe Luſts?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Never make your Fleſh your Favourite.</hi> If a Prince take a Rebel for a Friend, and take him into his Boſom, not only his Government, but his Life is in danger. How was it with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when he took in <hi>Delilah</hi> into his Boſom? She betrayed his ſtrength from him, She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend this Fleſh, it will betray you, it will betray you into the hands of the Devil; little do you think what miſchief you are working to your ſelves, whilſt you favour your Fleſh. In nouriſhing your corrupt Fleſh, you nouriſh a Viper, that will ſting you to the Heart. Know it for your Enemy, and keep it off from you as your Enemy. Do not gratifie and pleaſe and pamper your Fleſh, but ſtarve it rather, and crucifie it. If we would be ſo wiſe, as to count our luſts our Enemies, and deal with them as our Enemies, deal more hardly, and more ſeverely with them, we ſhould rid our ſelves of much of our danger, and of our diſturbance in the ordering our hearts.</p>

            <p>Do not ask Counſel of your Fleſh, nor take its Counſel. If you would know what you ſhould eat or drink, or to what meaſure, do not ask your Appetites counſel; that would ſay, eat to the full, ſpare not for coſt; eat what thou haſt a mind to, drink whilſt thou liſteſt. Do not
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48705:111"/>
ask your Pride, how ſhall I be cloathed? what Garments ſhall I wear, what Faſhion ſhall I uſe? If you ask your Pride, what counſel do you think 'twould give you? Do not ask your Covetouſneſs, what alms ſhall I give, what good ſhall I do with my Eſtate, where ſhall I beſtow what I have? keep it to thy ſelf, keep it for thine own, make thee great with what thou haſt gotten; build thee an Houſe, and build thee a Name in the Earth, for a Rich and Wealthy man; get what thou canſt, and then leave thy ſubſtance for thy Babes, thy Children after thee; that's the Counſel that Covetouſneſs would give. Do not ask thy ſloth, what pains is needful to be taken for God or thy Soul; whether induſtry and diligence in working out thy ſalvation be ſo neceſſary; Sloth will counſel thee, take thine eaſe, do not make the way to Heaven harder or ſtraighter then God hath made it, favour thy ſelf, and do not expoſe thy ſelf to too much hardneſs.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, you have Multitudes of Luſts, that will be ready to give you counſel in every caſe, but take heed, take counſel of none of them. Take counſel of God, take counſel of the Scriptures, take counſel of Conſcience; how would God have me to uſe my Eſtate? What Almes would he have me to give? What Bounty, what Liberality doth he call me to? How would God and Conſcience have me to feed my ſelf, and cloath my ſelf? Doth God ſay as this Pride ſays? On with thy Ornaments, follow the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, deck thy ſelf with that attire that will beſt pleaſe thee; doth God ſay as thine Appetite ſays? Eat whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thine heart luſteth after, drink as much, and fit at it as long as thou haſt a mind to? Doth Conſcience ſay, as this ſloth ſayeth? Favour thy ſelf, take thine eaſe, be not too painful and induſtrious for thy Soul, be not too ſtrict or too preciſe, nor expoſe thy ſelf to the contempt and ſcorn of the World, by thy zeal in Religion? Take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God Chriſtians, take counſel of Scripture and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but do not make Fleſh and Blood your Counſellors: To make your Fleſh your Counſellour, is to take the Malefactor from the Barr to the Bench, and there ſet it in Judgment in its own caſe; your Luſts are the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, that are to be conſulted againſt, to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and crucified; to the Barr with them, let them have ſentence againſt them, but let them not be called up to the Bench to be conſulted withal.</p>

            <p>O Friends, that you were deeply ſenſible what a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and mortal Enemy this carnal mind, this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart, theſe Fleſhly Luſts are to you; ſay of theſe, not only as <hi>Rebekah</hi> of the Daughters of <hi>Heth,</hi> I am weary of my life, but I am in danger of my life, becauſe of the Daughters of <hi>Heth.</hi> O it were a comfort, might one hear Chriſtians more heartily groaning under their Tyranny; Wo is me becauſe of this proud heart, wo is me becauſe of this froward pettiſh angry impatient Spirit; O this envy, O this Earthlineſs, O this ſluggiſhneſs; wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me? It would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to hear you groaning; I do not ſay complaining; complaints often come not deep, but ſighing and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning in ſecret, before him who ſeeth in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, this hearty mourning and affliction under your Luſts, is a degree of ſtriving againſt them; and hearty ſtriving is a degree of victory over them. When you are once come heartily to ſay, I can never have eaſe, and I will never have peace with this pride, or Covetouſneſs, or any of my Luſts; and if they abide in me, they ſhall never abide in peace in me; if I cannot utterly conquer them, through the help of God, I will never give over fighting againſt them; if they remain in me, I hope they ſhall never again reign in me; I will reſiſt them, I will pray againſt them, I will watch againſt them, I hope I ſhall never again reſign up to this Pride, or this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, but will withſtand them, in the Name of the Lord will I withſtand them; to him I reſign up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of my Soul, in hope that he will make my Foes

my Foot-ſtoole. Friends, ſuch a reſolved and effectual ſtriving againſt Luſt, is a fair degree of conqueſt, and when your Enemies are thus put under your Feet, you may then with the more eaſe, have the Government of your ſelves upon your Shoulders. But O beware of a Fleſh favouring Heart, beware of a Luſt excuſing heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The good party.</hi> Grace muſt be excited and upheld. Chriſtians muſt hold an hard hand, and a ſtraight hand upon Luſt, upon every Luſt; there's no good to be done whilſt theſe are ſuffered; and they muſt quicken and cheriſh and encourage every little ſpark of the Grace of God. Theſe are the good Subjects in the Kingdom, which muſt be countenanced and upheld. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>That good thing which is committed to thee keep by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Whatever that good thing was that's there meant, it is certain, that the Grace of God is the great good thing that muſt be kept; keep it ſafe that it be not loſt; keep it alive, that it grow not to decay; keep it in good like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nouriſh and cheriſh the Grace of God. Kings muſt be nurſing Fathers, Queens nurſing Mothers to their good Subjects; So muſt Chriſtians be to the good in their hearts; keep Grace in good plight, and keep it in good order, keep it in action Let your Faith be working Faith, let your Love and your Holy deſires be working Love, and working deſires. There's no way to keep Grace in Life, without you keep it in action; Holy action is both the end of keeping Grace in Life, and the means to maintain its life.</p>
            <p>O Chriſtians, keep your Graces in conſtant exerciſe; be buſily working for God and Glory; do not let theſe precious Talents ruſt for want of uſe; whilſt Grace lies idle or aſleep, then Luſt Lords it in the Soul. If you keep it not in conſtant action, to the crucifying of Luſt, Luſt will be buſie a crucifying of Grace.</p>
            <p>VVhat Government will there be, when Governours ſide with, and take the part of evil ones, and curb and diſcountenance, or take part againſt them that are good? If you would govern your hearts aright, take part with the Grace that is in you, and take up Arms againſt Luſt. Thou haſt Pride in thy heart, thou haſt frowardneſs, thou haſt Covetouſneſs, but wilt thou take part with theſe? VVilt thou be on the ſide of thy luſts? Tread upon them; be glad, be thankful for every word, for every Friend
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48705:113"/>
that will ſpeak againſt the Pride and Covetouſneſs of thy Heart. Be not angry when thou art checked or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, be thankful for any thing that ſpeaks againſt them. But take part with the good that is in you; when the Spirit luſteth againſt the fleſh, when Grace riſes and reſiſts Corruption, when the intereſt of Chriſt within thee, croſſeth and contradicteth the intereſt of the Fleſh, take part with Chriſt and his Grace. We are too apt to take part with our Fleſh, when we do not think we do. When the Fleſh enticeth us to what we would have, this liberty, or that gain, or pleaſure, we ſometimes to do our Fleſh a kindneſs, will ſtudy arguments to prove it good and right, which Fleſh would have. Though it be naught or pernicious, yet becauſe its pleaſing to our Fleſh, we do what we can to prove it lawful and good. This is a taking part with the fleſh, a ſiding with and ſtrengthning this Rebel.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, when Grace calls us to Duties that are contrary to the Fleſh, to hard and ſelf-denying Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; to more ſtrictneſs, to more Severity then our fleſh can bear, then we often ſtudy Objections againſt it; Chriſt is not ſo auſtere—, but while we thus take part with the fleſh, the evil that is in us, and thereby take part againſt the good that is in us, what Government is there like to be, all the while in thoſe hearts, where the Rebels are ſided with, and the good Subjects diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and oppoſed?</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>In ſtrengthning the ſinews of Government, Rewards and Puniſhments.</hi> What are laws? what Government can there be if there were no Rewards and Puniſhments? Who would obey, if there were no reward to obedience? who would fear to rebel, if men ſhould ſuffer nothing for their rebellion? Rewards and Puniſhments, are the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſtrength of Laws. Now for the ſtrengthning of theſe ſinews of Government, conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is an eternal World.</hi> After we have made an end in this World, there is another where we muſt have a being. Man dyeth not as a beaſt dyeth, as a Dog or a Swine; as a Wiſeman dieth not as a Fool dieth, ſo neither do Wiſe men or Fools, die as a Beaſt dieth; there is not an end of us when we die, as there is of the Beaſts that periſh; we paſs away out of this, into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World.

The Spirit of a man, is the Candle of the Lord; and when this Candle is once lighted, it ſhall never go out. Its carried away hence, but its carried to God that gave it. The Souls of all men, good and bad, when they die, do all go to God; even thoſe that go to the Devil, are firſt carried to God, by him to receive their Sentence to their everlaſting ſtate. Sinners when they die, go not to God as their Reward, or Bleſſedneſs, but to God as their Judge. Sinners will ſay as Chriſt did, Luke 23.46. <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi> but God will ſay to them, who are ye? <hi>away from me ye workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I know you not,</hi> Mat. 7.23. I am none of your Father, ye are of your Father the Devil; get you down to him. Commend your Spirits to me? what have you given up your Souls to the Devil, and all your life long have they been ſerving of him, and he been corrupting and deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, blinding them, hardning them, made them ſuch a filthy and unclean thing, and now do ye think to come off ſo, to commend theſe filthy and unclean Souls to me? away with them, I'le none of them. If thoſe that are ſanctified by my Spirit, and ſerve me with their Spirit, come to me when they die, I'le take them to me; I will acknowledge my ſelf their Father, they ſhall dwell with me; but thoſe that have ſerved ſin, and the Devil while they lived, let not them think to commend their Spirits to me when they die, I'le none of them. Well but whether we muſt dwell with God or the Devil, into the other World all Souls, good and bad muſt paſs when they go hence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is an eternal Judgement.</hi> So the Apoſtle tells us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. of the Doctrine of <hi>eternal Judgment.</hi> It is call'd an Eternal Judgement, not as if the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould laſt for ever; in how long or how ſhort a time, that judgment ſhall be diſpatched, no man certainly knows; the glorious God can make ſhort work, and will do ſo, in that great and dreadful day. Its called Eternal Judgment becauſe it ſentenceth men to their everlaſting ſtate, and its the laſt judgment, there ſhall never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to all Eternity, but the ſentence of this Judgment ſhall ſtand for ever. 2 Cor. 5.10. <hi>We muſt all ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment</hi> — Rom. 2.6. <hi>Who will render to every
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48705:114"/>
man according to his works— to them that by patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in wel-doing, do ſeek for glory honour and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, eternal Life; but to them that are contentious, and obey not the truth, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, to every Soul of them that do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In the Judgment to come, the ſecrets of the heart ſhall be opened and judged:</hi> Men ſhall be judged for their words, men ſhall be judged for their deeds, but not for theſe only, but for the ſecrets of their hearts. Eccl. 12.14. <hi>God ſhall bring every work to Judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</hi> The Judgments of men are only over our Bodies, and outward Acts; they know not our hearts, and therefore cannot be our hearts Judges. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God ſees the heart. I the Lord ſearch the heart and try the reins.</hi> Jer. 17.10. <hi>He ſeeth in ſecret, and he that ſeeth in ſecret, will reward openly;</hi> Mat. 6.4.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſeeth the good that is in ſecret, the love and fear of his Name, our inward deſires and thirſtings and breathings after him; every holy thought, every holy purpoſe, the inward mournings of the heart, under ſin and temptation, the inward ſtrivings &amp; wreſtlings of the heart, againſt temptation and corruption, our ſelf-loathings and ſelf abaſings, the integrity and uprightneſs of our hearts; whilſt men are cenſuring or reproaching or puniſhing us as hypocrites, God ſees the integrity that is in our Souls. O Friends, get an honeſt upright heart in the ſight of God, you ſhall never looſe the benefit and bleſſedneſs of it, God ſees the ſincerity of the upright, and will certainly reward it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſeeth the evil that is in ſecret; the proud heart, the falſe and guileful heart are open before him. Beware of playing the Hypocrite, of ſatisfying your ſelves with Hypocritical Duties, hypocritical Praying, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Hearing, or Profeſſing, God ſees what that heart of thine is a doing, while thy tongue is a praying, or thine ear hearing, thou mayſt deceive men and thine own ſelf, but God cannot be deceived.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſecrets of the heart ſhall be opened and judged in that Judgment of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.5. <hi>Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and make manifeſt the Counſels of the heart, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:48705:114"/>1. The things of the heart are hidden and dark things. The thoughts of the heart dark thoughts, the Counſels of the Lord dark Counſels, even the good things that are in the heart, are to all others but dark things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the day of Judgment, theſe things of darkneſs ſhall be all brought to light; the ſecrets ſhall be all made manifeſt. What a ſight will there be in that day, when the hearts of all the World, ſhall be ſeen as it were at one view; What a bleſſed ſight will there be, when all the Beauty and inward Glory of the Saints, all their Graces, ſhall be ſeen! What a black ſight alſo will there be, when all the filth and garbage that is in ſinners hearts, all the venemous brood, all the Cockatrices eggs, that ever have been hatch'd in thoſe unclean hearts; when all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Counſels and Devices of their hearts, all the Curſes and Blaſphemies, all the Couzenage and Fraud of the heart, all the wicked Plots and Contrivances of the heart againſt God or his Saints, all the Adulteries and Filthineſs of the heart, all the Madneſs and Follies of the heart, all the Malice, and Spite, and Rage of the heart: when all theſe ſhall be preſented at one view, O what an odious ſight will there be! Sinners, do not cheat your ſelves in your ſinful ways, with hopes of Secrecy; for all muſt be brought to light. If all that wickedneſs and hypocriſie, if thoſe filthy luſts and unclean thoughts, that are in your hearts ſhould be now ſeen, by all this Congregation, how would you be aſhamed, and how would you bluſh to look any body in the Face! but becauſe thy naughty heart and its naughty thoughts, and deſires cannot be ſeen, thou mayeſt be a proud fellow, of a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heart, of a diſſembling lying heart, and no body the wiſer, therefore thou letteſt thy ſelf alone to be as thou art; as long as thou haſt a ſecret covering for all thy ugly Conditions, 'tis well enough; but do not cheat thy ſelf thus, all theſe hidden things of darkneſs muſt be brought to light, thou muſt be turned inſide outward, and all the ſhame of thy Nakedneſs, and thy Naughtineſs be made appear, and be laid open before God Angels and Men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There are eternal Rewards and Puniſhments, that in this Judgment of God, ſhall be awarded to every ſoul.</hi> What ever the ſtate of your Souls ſhall then be found to be, they
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48705:115"/>
ſhall receive a due recompence of reward, and eternal recompence. Therefore this Judgment, as I told you before, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. is call'd an eternal Judgment, becauſe it appoints to every man an eternal reward. To the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and renewed and upright hearts, it appoints Eternal Bleſſedneſs for their Reward; to the impenitent wicked and unrenewed Hearts, it appointeth Eternal Torment for their Reward. Mat. 25.48. <hi>Theſe,</hi> the wicked, <hi>ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi> O what a weight is there in the Crown of Glory, that ſhall be the reward of the righteous. The Apoſtle calls it <hi>an exceeding eternal weight of Glory</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. And O what a weight is there in that Curſe, and that wrath that ſhall be the reward of the Wicked! how will it break the backs and cruſh the bones, and tear the bowels, and burn the Souls, of every wicked one! Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, a fire, a fire is prepared for you. What Torment is like the Torment of fire, and what fire is like the fire of Hell! But O that word, <hi>Eternity, Eternity,</hi> that's the ſcalding and ſcorching Word; Everlaſting Fire that ſhall never be quenched. How weary are the days, how long are the nights to a ſick man, that's tormented in his bed? but what will an eternal night be, that ſhall never know morning! <hi>Who can dwell with the devouring fire, who can dwell with everlaſting burnings,</hi> Iſa. 33.14. It is fire that you muſt have your dwelling in; It is devouring fire that will devour all your former g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ins and pleaſures of ſin; as the lean kine in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream, did eat up the fat ones, This fire ſhall eat up all your pleaſant dayes and merry nights. Ye will devour your ſelves; theſe Bodies and Souls it will devour; it will devour by burning, a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting burning. O dreadful! ſinners, do not your hearts yet tremble? what not to think of burning? de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring burning? how do ye think that ye ſhall look upon ſin, when theſe Bodies and theſe Souls of yours ſhall be all on a light fire? when thoſe Eyes, and that Tongue, and thoſe Hands, and every Limb, ſhall be all glowing fire, as red hot iron in a Furnace? how do ye think ye ſhall endure it? but yet you have not all, the worſt is yet behind; 'tis <hi>Everlaſting</hi> burnings, fire that ſhall never be quenched. O that word, <hi>Never, never, never an end,</hi> what a burning Dagger will it be, in the Souls of thoſe damned ones? think what it hath already
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48705:115"/>
been to <hi>Judas,</hi> who hath been burning in this fire, above 1600 years; think what it hath been to <hi>Cain,</hi> that hath been burning there almoſt ever ſince the World began, above 5000 years, and yet are burning ſtill at this day; what a long and diſmal time have they had of it already? but all this is not ſo much as a minute, or a moment to thoſe Everlaſting Ages of Torment, that are ſtill to run out, and will never be expired. Such are the Rewards of the Wicked, Torment, Torment in extremity, and Torment to Eternity; and the upright heart ſhall be rewarded with a weight of Glory and Joy, and this ſhall be an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal Glory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>A ſenſe of theſe eternal Rewards, is the very ſtrength and ſinews of Government,</hi> Where I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What I mean by a ſenſe of theſe eternal things.</hi> There are three things in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A believing theſe things.</hi> That there is ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Judgment, and Eternal Reward. Theſe things are certain, Pſal. 58.11. <hi>Verity there is a reward for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, verily he is a God that Judgeth in the earth.</hi> And as verily as there is a reward for the righteous, ſo verily there is a reward for the Sinner. Theſe things are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and theſe things muſt be believed. Heb. 11.6. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that God is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> And as he muſt be believed a Rewarder of them that ſeek him, ſo a Revenger of them that ſlight him, and diſobey him. He that cometh to God, and will obtain this Reward, and eſcape this vengeance, muſt believe this, or he will never come. The reaſon of the Rebellion of mens hearts againſt God, is their unbelief; believe the Judgment of God, and that will bring you under his Government. When you come to ſay, verily 'tis ſo, this is no ſable or deluſion, 'tis certainly ſo, 'tis undoubtedly ſo, ſuch a Judgment there ſhall be, ſuch rewards there ſhall be given, as veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if I ſaw it done, then your hearts will be govern'd, and never till then</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>An underſtanding what theſe rewards ſhall be.</hi> What great and wonderful Rewards they are. Things to come muſt be known ere they will affect. Heady ſinners, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſay, they believe, yet they little know what 'tis to believe. They know not what 'tis to be ſaved, they know not what 'tis to be damned. Pſal. 92.6, 7. <hi>A brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48705:116"/>
man knoweth not, neither doth a fool underſtand this. When the wicked ſpring up, as the graſs, and all the workers of iniquity do flouriſh, it is that they ſhould be deſtroyed for ever.</hi> A brutiſh man underſtandeth not this neither, that ſinners ſhall be deſtroyed, nor what a dreadful deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their deſtruction ſhall be. Its true theſe things to come cannot be perfectly known here; we know but in part, we underſtand but imperfectly; 1 Cor. 13.9. 1 Joh. 3 2. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> Now are we Sons of God, but it doth not <hi>yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> And ſo of ſinners, now are they the children of the Devil, but it doth not yet appear what they ſhall be. Sinners that are brands prepared for the burning, do little think what that burning is, that is prepared for them; and they ſhall never know it perfectly, till they come there. But yet ſuch a knowledge of theſe great and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing things may be had here, as may work mightily towards the governing of the heart; and a knowledge there muſt be of them, or they will never work. There is a <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> that's gotten by believing, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of theſe things. Pſal. 107.43. <hi>Who ſo is wiſe will ponder theſe things, and they ſhall underſtand the loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord;</hi> and as his loving kindneſs, ſo his Wrath and indignation; and there is an <hi>after-knowledge</hi> or an experimental knowledge. Some ſinners will never know what hell is, till they know it by experience; till they fail into the pit, and the ſenſe of that wrath, when they come to be preyed upon and wrap'd up in the devouring Flames, teach them what a dreadful wrath it is. Beware ſinners of ſuch an experimental knowledge of Hell; wherein your fleſh and your bones, and the Torments of them, ſhall make you know, what now you will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. 'Tis a <hi>foreknowledge,</hi> by obſerving and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what is written, and preach'd of theſe great things, that is neceſſary to your preſent Government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A feeling of theſe things.</hi> I mean now, a feeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand; a feeling that's gotten by your fore-knowledge. What we believe and underſtand if they be great things, will make impreſſions upon our ſenſes. By the knowledge of God, and of the bleſſedneſs of Heaven, the Saints get ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>es of that Glory and Bleſſedneſs. 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>If we have ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d that the Lord is gracious.</hi> And by the knowledge of the Wrath and Judgments of God, ſome
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48705:116"/>
ſinners get a taſte of that wrath; it makes their hearts to begin to burn above ground. There's an heaven begun in the hearts of Saints, and an hell begun in the hearts of ſome Sinners.</p>
            <p>And this now is that, which I mean by a ſenſe of the things to come; the getting ſuch a belief of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of theſe things, ſuch an underſtanding of the greatneſs of theſe things, that may deeply affect the Heart; that may leave powerful impreſſions on the Senſes; that the heart may be powerfully moved and deeply affected with them. Sinners hearts are as ſtones and ſenſeleſs ſtocks, when we have ſpoken to them of the deep things of God, we may ſay of theſe eternal things, as the Apoſtle of his temporal Sufferings, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. None of theſe things move them, or will in the leaſt work upon them; but if we could let in a little more light into their Minds, if we could ſhew them ſome glimpſes of the Glory to ſome, ſome flaſhes of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire, this would make thoſe ſtocks to feel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſenſe of the eternal things is the ſinews of Government.</hi> There can be no Government without Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and if theſe Rewards and Puniſhments be not believed, known and perceived, its all one as to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if there were none at all. 'Tis the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſenſe of theſe Rewards, that is the ſtrength of Government.</p>
            <p>Now there is according to the two different Rewards, a different ſenſe of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>an alluring encouraging and obliging ſenſe:</hi> A ſenſe of the Magnificence, of the Kindneſs and Mercies of the Lord will encourage to Subjection and obedience to him. It will draw forth our love, and ſtir up all our Powers, to active Obedience. O how would the lively ſenſe of God and the bleſſedneſs of Heaven kindle Affection en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our deſires, raiſe our hopes, and fill us with joy? What would be loved as God is loved? what would be deſired as God is deſired? what would be hoped for, as heaven is hoped for? what would our love or deſires or hopes find too much to be done or ſuffered, where there is a deep ſenſe of theſe great things, that ſhall be the reward of all.</p>
            <p>And how would ſuch a lively ſenſe of God and of heaven, abate our love, and cool our deſires after earth
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48705:117"/>
and the things thereof? Who would regard duſt and ſtones and traſh, that had Gold and Pearles before him? what would this money be, theſe Sheep and Oxen be, theſe carnal pleaſures and ſports be, how eaſily could they be wanted, how little would they be loved or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, were that Glory, Honour, Immortality that is above, more before our Eye and upon our Hearts? you complain you can't get your hearts looſned and diſintangled from theſe earthly things; O 'tis becauſe heaven is ſo much out of ſight: you have ſo little ſenſe of the good things to come, that hence it is you fall a luſting ſo after the good things preſent. Get more ſenſe of God into your hearts, and you will feel your Affections to fall, and abate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe earthly things. <hi>Look on the things not ſeen,</hi> as the Apoſtle did, 2 Cor. 4.18. Upon the things that <hi>are eternal,</hi> and you will diſdain and contemn, <hi>the things that are ſeen which are but Temporal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſenſe of the puniſhments to come will be an awing ſenſe.</hi> The ſeverities of the Lord, and his dreadful wrath and vengeance would awe the heart into ſubjection to him. O what an influence would this have upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning our fears, and our griefs and our anger? whom ſhould we then fear but God? what would the wrath of man be, what would temporal ſufferings be, how little would they be feared, were there a due awe of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts? your awe of God would ſay the ſame to you as the Prophet. Iſa. 2.22. <hi>Ceaſe ye from man,</hi> truſt not in him, and fear him not; and as Chriſt ſaid, Rev. 2.10. <hi>Fear none of thoſe things you ſhall ſuffer.</hi> And Luk. 12.5. <hi>Fear not them that kill the body</hi> — fear God who is able to caſt into Hell. Whom ſhould we then fear but God? and what ſhould we then fear but ſin againſt God, which maketh ſo obnoxious to his wrath? you that now make light of Sin, can lye, and defraud, and be covetous, and do any thing elſe your hearts lead you to, and make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, or but a ſmall matter, Get an awe of God on your hearts, and your ſins would make you tremble, and what an influence would it have upon the ſuppreſſing your ſinful Anger? it would take up all our quarrels; a ſenſe of Heaven and Hell would make us all friends, thoſe great things would ſwallow up the leſſer. What do I ſtand vexing and fretting mv ſelf at every one that croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me? how ſtands it with my Soul to God ward?
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48705:117"/>
how may I eſcape the wrath to come? Is it peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Almighty and my Soul? Friends, 'tis a ſign that you have little ſenſe of your eternal conceraments, where every little thing ſo exceſſively moves, and diſturbs your Spirits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>How to get and maintain upon our hearts, this ſenſe of the eternal things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things, I have told you, are ſuppoſed to this ſenſe, a believing, and an underſtanding theſe great things; and to the improving of what we believe, and underſtand of them, there's a third thing neceſſary, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and frequent thinking upon them. Exerciſe your thoughts more upon the Eternal World; ſpend more thoughts, think oftner upon it, and ſpend more deep thoughts of heart upon them. Our thinking and meditating, is the ſame with that looking on the things not ſeen, mentioned before, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. Look more Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venward, and look more towards hell, and this will affect your hearts; particularly think theſe three thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Think this thought, <hi>In this eternal world I muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be,</hi> one of theſe two Rewards muſt be my Reward; one of theſe two States, Eternal Bleſſedneſs or Eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, muſt be my State. That Heaven which I now hear Preach'd of, that Hell which I now am warned of, I ſhall be [in] one of them, in a little while. As ſure as I am alive, and here this day, ſo ſure ſhall I be in Heaven or Hell a few days hence, What's become of thoſe many that were alive a few years ſince, that I knew and was acquainted with, and did eat and drink with, and buy and ſell with, that now are no more ſeen? Where are they all? they are all paſſed over, and gone into the other World, They are gone, and I am following after, I muſt ſhortly be with them. The Saints that are dead and gone, they are entred into their Reward, they are gone to Chriſt, they are entred into the joy of their Lord; and if I be one of them, partaker of the ſame Faith, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame holy ſteps, I alſo ſhall have the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The ſinners that are dead and gone, they are entred into their Reward; ſhut out from the Preſence and Joy of the Lord, and ſhut up under Chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and burning in the Furnace of Fire; and if I follow them in their ſins, and be impenitent therein, a little
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48705:118"/>
while hence I ſhall I ſhall overtake them; I ſhall have [my] chain with them, my furnace with them.</p>
            <p>Well let this be one thought of your hearts, how near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you are all concern'd in the other World, and how certainly you ſhall be there. As ſure as you have a being for a time in this World, ſo ſure ſhall you every one of you have an Eternal being in the other World; either in the everlaſting pleaſures above, or the everlaſting pangs and plagues below.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Think much this thought, <hi>Which of theſe two ſtates in Eternity muſt be my state, is determining every day.</hi> It is thy preſent life, thine every days courſe here, that muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Caſe, whither thou muſt, when thou goeſt hence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8. Thy reward muſt be according to thy work, thy reaping muſt be according to thy ſowing. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8. Think with your ſelves, I am every day working for Eternity, ſowing for Everlaſting; what would you reap? what would you, ſhould be your reward in the other world? I know what you would anſwer here, I would reap in Mercy, I would be rewarded in Joy and Glory. But what [muſt] you reap, where muſt your reward be? why that you are every day determining. Look what your ways and your works are, ſuch your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward muſt be, <hi>Sow in Righteouſneſs and you ſhall reap in mercy,</hi> Hoſ. 10.12. <hi>Sow in tears, and you ſhall reap in j y.</hi> Pſal. 126.6. But if you ſow in Tares, ſow to your fleſh, ſow Sin and Vanity, I leave it to your ſelves to judge, what your reaping muſt be.</p>
            <p>Were ſuch thoughts abiding upon our hearts, what manner of Perſons ſhould we then be? Is this the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my life? Is this the great debate of every day, where mine everlaſting dwelling muſt be, whether in the Paradi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of God, or in the dungeon with Devils, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in everlaſting Bleſſedneſs, or Burnings? Is this the great queſtion to be reſolved and determined, <hi>what I ſhall be hereafter,</hi> by what I am every day? O no more ſinning againſt God; O no more neglecting of Chriſt; O no more hardneſs and impenitency of heart; O no more of this worldlineſs, or wantonneſs, or drunkenneſs; mine heart ſhakes to think, whither theſe are carrying me, and where they will lay me. Ariſe O my Soul, ſhake off theſe Luſts, ſhake thy ſelf out of ſleep; 'tis high time to awaken; ſtop, ſtop this evil courſe; caſt off the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48705:118"/>
works of darkneſs, leaſt thou be ſuddenly ſwallowed up of Everlaſting darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Think this thought, <hi>The state and the way of mine [heart] is the great thing that must determine what mine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal state muſt be.</hi> My works muſt determine what my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward muſt be, and the ſtate of mine heart will determine what my works will be.</p>
            <p>Well now, exerciſe your ſelves to ſuch thoughts; dwell in ſuch Meditations; and think not that you have done any thing to purpoſe, till your thoughts have begotten ſtrong impreſſions upon your hearts, and you are wrought to a ſenſe of thoſe great things, and let your ſenſe of them be an abiding ſenſe.</p>
            <p>O what even and ſteady lives ſhould we then live; the evenneſs of our lives will be both the beauty of our Converſations, when there is a due proportion of our dayes one to another, this will make our lives beautiful; and 'twill be, the evidence of our integrity. Fits of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, fits of holy Affections, will prove little to us of our uprightneſs; our deadneſs and dumps, when thoſe fits are overs will weaken all our hopes and confidences, and call all into queſtion. It is our ſtanding holy Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that will be our ſtanding Comfort.</p>
            <p>O friends, how uneven and unſteady are we? what unſtable Souls? what wandring ſtars are we? how ſadly different are we from our ſelves? ſometimes in our ſecret duties, or at publick Ordinances, our hearts ſeem full of God, full of heavenly Affections. What movings, what meltings, what enlargements of heart do we feel? all ſpirit, and love, and joy, and then ſhortly after, behold all is loſt; our Sun dips into a Cloud, the ſtars fall to the Earth, our Spirits ſink and flag, and the fleſh gets up again. O if we could but hold in the ſerene temper we ſometimes are in, what a life ſhould we have of it! but it doth not hold; we are given to Changes, the temper of our hearts often change with our buſineſs and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; when we are buſying our ſelves about the things of God, then we are ſpiritual and heavenly, ('twere well if it were ſo always) when we are called forth about our earthly employments, we become as earthly as other men. Do you none of you find it ſo? do you not complain 'tis ſo? Lord help me, it is even too true, I even find it ſo with me; ſometimes our tempers change with our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48705:119"/>
when we are converſant with thoſe that fear God, there is ſome Spirit, and ſome ſavour in our Converſes, O it were well if it were alwayes ſo; ſometimes and too often, we are barren, and carnal and dead, in the beſt Society, our converſing with Chriſtians, is too often an uſeleſs, and carnal, and unſavoury Converſe. But if it be better with us, when in good company, how doth it uſe to be, when we fall into carnal company, or vain company? we ſeem to have even quite loſt our God, and our Religion, our eternal concernments are laid by, and our care about them is intermitted, our God and our Souls are thruſt behind the door, or trodden under foot.</p>
            <p>Whence is all this? O our ſenſe of eternal things, is for the time worn off. Brethren, God is the ſame God, Mal. 3.6. I <hi>am the Lord, I change not.</hi> There's the ſame eye of God upon you, wherever you be, he that looks how you carry it in your Duties, looks upon you in your buſineſſes, looks upon you in every company. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are; and as God is the ſame God, ſo your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting concernments are ſtill the ſame; Heaven is as much to be deſired, Hell as much to be feared, your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be as carefully wrought out; you have as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs lying upon you every where, as you have any where, and this work will never proſper, if it hath not your conſtant care. 'Tis true, we are not to ſpeak the ſame words, in all Companies, and our behaviour is not to be alike, in its particular Circumſtances, in all Companies; but in the general, a ſerious and holy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the carrying our ſelves ſo as men that are in a journey heavenwards, the owning and propagating ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion, the behaving our ſelves ſo, that others may evidently ſee the ſpirit of Glory, and of God reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and may be both convinced that God is in us of a truth, and if it be poſſible, be gained to God; or at leaſt made aſhamed of their own ſinful and carnal ways. Such a temper ſhould we be in, and ſuch a carriage ſhould we be of, in what Company ſoever we be; we are alwayes in the ſight of God, and we ſhould be no where but upon buſineſs for God, and we ſhould carry our ſelves as ſuch; What the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſhould be exemplified in the practiſe of Chriſtians, 2 Cor. 2.17. <hi>As of ſincerity, as of God, in the ſight of God,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48705:119"/>
ſo ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi> Wherever you are, behave your ſelves in ſincerity, in ſimplicity; whatever you ſpeak, ſpeak it as in the ſight of God; be faithful, approve your ſelves to God in all that you do.</p>
            <p>O friends, this, even this ſteady, this ſincere courſe of life, this univerſal approving your ſelves to God in all you do, will be the fruit of ſuch an abiding ſenſe of God upon your hearts. This will be the poiſe that will make you move ſwiftly, this will be the Ballaſt, that will make you ſail ſteadily. And this ſwift and ſteady motion hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venward, will both make you appear to be Chriſtians indeed, and mightily improve and advance your ſouls, in that grace of God that bringeth Salvation. O beloved that this now might be the fruit of theſe many words, that I have ſpoken to you; that you would, every one of you, ſet your hearts to it, to get and to hold, ſuch a deep ſenſe of the eternal things upon your ſpirits, as might have influence to the carrying you on in this even and ſteady courſe. Do not every one of you need ſome eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment? more ſettledneſs, more fixedneſs in an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame? do not you feel your ſelves ſo up and down, ſo off and on, that you can hardly fix? Would it not be more comfortable for you, if you could get to be more like the unchangeable God, that as he is the ſame God, ſo you might be the ſame Chriſtians, of the ſame Spirit, of the ſame way, ſo fixed and compoſed in your Spirits, that you might not be moved from the hope, nor from the holineſs of the Goſpel? would it not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to you, were it thus with you? would it not be much to the honour of the Goſpel, and to the joy of your own Souls? then once again, I exhort you by the Lord Jeſus, get this ſight of God in your eye, keep this ſenſe of God upon your hearts, which will have its fruit unto this ſettled and even courſe of holineſs, the end whereof will be everlaſting life. This is that which I ſtrive for, and am reaching towards in mine own Soul, and I muſt ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. I preſs theſe things upon you, <hi>not as though I had already obtained, but I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after if</hi> I <hi>may obtain through Christ Jeſus.</hi> And what I ſeek, and wait, and hope for in mine own Soul, my hearts deſire is, that you alſo may follow after, and be partakers of the ſame Grace, that my Soul is in purſuit of,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48705:120"/>
that you and I may rejoyce together in the day of the Lord. Thus much for the keeping the heart under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Keep the Heart under Guard.</hi> Keep it, and all the good that's in it in ſafety, that it be not loſt. Chriſtians muſt keep their Hearts, as Worldlings keep their Money, and their Jewels, and their writings, by which they hold their Eſtates. If they have any ſtronger or ſafer place than other, there they lay them up, and whatever elſe they have to look to, their ſpecial eye and their ſtricteſt Watch, is upon their treaſure. And here I ſhall ſhew you,

               </gap>ets of life. The heart is the fountain from whence all our living ſtreams do flow. Chriſt is our life, and the ſeat or habitation of Chriſt is in the heart; therefore that expreſſion, Col. 1.27. <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of Glory.</hi> The hope of the Saints is a living and lively hope, the life of our hope is from Chriſt, and from Chriſt within us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. Chriſt dwells in the heart by Faith. The heart Natural, is the fountain of Natural Life, it is the <hi>primum vivens;</hi> and the heart Spiritual is the fountain of Spiritual Life; we begin to live from within; as death begins in the heart, ſo life.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48705:120"/>
Death Natural ends in the heart, the heart is the laſt that dieth, but death ſpiritual begins in the heart, the heart is the firſt that dies. Sinners dead works do all ariſe from their dead hearts; the root dies firſt, and then the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and fruit wither and fall off; the Devils great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is, firſtly upon the heart, when he hath ſlain the good that is within, he can with eaſe deſtroy whatever good is without, the fruit will fall off of it ſelf, when the root is dead. The heart is the firſt that dies, in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſenſe, and 'tis the firſt that lives. It is there the ſeed of God, his immortal Seed, is firſt received, and takes its root; ſo that there is the ſame reaſon to ſet a guard upon our hearts, as to preſerve our life, if you would keep your ſelves alive, if you would not fall down among the dead, then look well to your hearts which are the fountain of life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is the ſpring of all our vital actions and operations.</hi> This is included in the former; the heart is the fountain of life, and life is the fountain of action. A dead man cannot ſee, nor hear, nor ſpeak, nor move, he muſt live before he can ſpeak or move. And what can the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dead do? <hi>The dead praiſe not the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 115.17. <hi>The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe thee,</hi> Iſ. 38.19. That is ſpoken, of the naturally dead, and living; and muſt we not ſay the ſame, of the ſpiritually dead, and the living Souls? dead Souls can't praiſe the Lord; they can't pray, nor believe, nor hope, nor ſerve the Lord; the living, the living Soul, it ſhall praiſe thee, it ſhall pray unto thee, and ſerve thee. Hypocrites are all dead at heart, and therefore all their ſervices are but dead ſervices; they make a ſhew, and keep a ſtir in the outward parts of Religion; they can talk as Chriſtians, and walk and move; but it is with theſe dead Souls, as with thoſe dead bodies, which we call walking Ghoſts; they look like men, and ſpeak like men, and go up and down like men, but ſtill they have no Soul in them; It is the Devil that acts in them, and ſpeaks in them, and carrieth them up and down; none of all their actions or motions are vital actions; the devil can make them ſpeak, and walk, and look like living men, but he cannot make them live; ſuch is the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites Religion, he can pray, and hear, and ſing, and ſpeak as Chriſtians do, but he is dead at heart, and thereupon all his duties are but dead duties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:48705:121"/>Friends, you are as much concerned to keep your hearts, as you are to be able to do any thing that will pleaſe God, or ſave your Souls. What is the intent of your Religion? why do ye come together to pray, and hear, and partake of the Table of the Lord? You will ſay, I come to perform theſe duties, to pleaſe the Lord, I come in order to the ſaving of my Soul. Do you ſo? then look to your hearts better, ſee that there be the root of Religion within you: ſee that your praying be the praying with the heart, that your hearing be not the opening your ear, but the opening of your heart to the Word; ſee that whatever you do, that hath any ſhew of Religion in it, you do it heartily; watch your hearts when you come into the houſe of the Lord, watch your hearts, when you ſet upon any work for God, leſt they give you the ſlip, and ſo make all your Services to be but <hi>bodily exerciſes,</hi> which as 1 Tim. 4.8. <hi>profit little.</hi> Bodily exerciſes, that is, the outward part of our Religion; Ear Religion, Tongue Religion, Knee Religion; theſe bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exerciſes, where there is not an heart at the bottom of them, profit nothing at all; they will do nothing to the pleaſing of God, or the ſaving our Souls.</p>
            <p>Friends, beware of Hypocriſie; take heed leſt any of you be found hypocrites; that your faith you ſeem to have, be not the faith of hypocrites, that your hope be not the Hypocrites hope, that your praying, and faſting, and almes, be not all the Sacrifices of hypocrites; and ſuch ſacrifices they are, if they be Sacrifices without an heart. Come not before the Lord with hollow Veſſels, which will make a ſound, but have nothing in them. We that look upon you, can't tell what there is within you; we ſee your faces, and hear your voices, but what is under, God knows; look you to it, that it be not all hollow, and empty within; he that ſeeth the heart, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what there is within; and will accept or reject ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he finds of the heart in all you do.</p>
            <p>Friends, What do ye here this day? have you brought with you ever a Sacrifice for God, ever a living Sacrifice? the living God will regard none of you, if you bring not a living Sacrifice. He doth not require of you, as he did of old, a Bullock, or a Ram for a Sacrifice; No, nor a Dove, nor a Lamb for a Sacrifice, it is a Soul for a Sacrifice, a living Soul, that is quickned and ſanctified by the Bloud and Spirit of Chriſt. And upon this account
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48705:121"/>
farther are you concerned to look to, and to keep your hearts; as ever you would do any thing in Religion, that is acceptable with God, or of any avail to your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The heart is the ſpring of all vital Actions, and they are only our vital Actions, our living and lively du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that will be accepted of the living God. Would you not be rejected for hypocrites? would you not <hi>compaſs the Lord about with lies,</hi> as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.12. would you not come before the Lord with lies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelves with lies? then ſee that you bring your hearts with you before him. Is there any life begotten in your hearts? is Chriſt formed upon you? is the Spirit of Chriſt poured forth into you? is there the life of God in your hearts? and is this the ſpring of all your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervices? then as you love your lives, as you fear to ſerve the living God with dead ſervice, ſet a careful guard upon your hearts, that neither theſe be ſtolen away from God, nor that life which is within you be ſtolen out of your hearts.</p>
            <p>Brethren, I would not that any of you be found hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; therefore do I labour with you, therefore do I preach to you, and warn every one of you, that you may be preſented perfect and upright in the day of the Lord. I would not that you be found hypocrites in that day, nor would I that your Religious actions be found hypocritical actions, in your preſent day. 'Tis ſaid of the limbs of Antichriſt, 1 Tim. 4.2. <hi>That they ſpeak lies in hypocriſies.</hi> I would have Chriſtians, not only none ſuch, as ſpeak lies in hypocriſie, no nor to ſpeak truth in hypocriſie, to do good in hypocriſie; and therefore 'tis, that I have ſpent ſo much time among you, upon this Subject of looking to your hearts, that theſe may be right with God, in all that you do. I fear there are hypocrites among you, I fear that much of the Religion of ſome of you, may be but hypocritical Religion; but look to your ſelves, and as you would be loth to have no better acceptance than hypocrites, as you would dread to have your portion with hypocrites, ſo dread it to ſatisfie your ſelves with hypocritical duties; ſerve the God of your hearts with an hearty ſervice; ſerve the true God, with an heart, and with a true heart; ſerve the living God with living hearts; ſee that there be the life of God in your hearts, and let the life within you, be the Spring of all your Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48705:122"/>
that all that ever you do in Religion be the iſſues of life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is the record of all the tranſactions, which have been betwixt Christ and your Soules.</hi> If ye be Chriſts, there have been great dealings betwixt Chriſt and your Souls; Chriſt hath been dealing with you; dealing with you by his word, dealing with you by his Spirit; inſtructing and enlightning your Souls, convincing and awakening your Hearts, perſwading and alluring your hearts after him; Chriſt hath been dealing with you, about your repenting and turning to the Lord, about your Reconciliation and making peace with God; God hath been in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling you to himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. You have not had us dealing with you, in the name of Chriſt, who are the Miniſters of Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. but he who is the great Reconciler, Chriſt himſelf hath been dealing with you, and hath reconciled you to God. So ſure as the Devil hath been dealing with ſinners, he hath drawn them away from God, drawn them to ſin and wickedneſs againſt God, hath been hardning them againſt God; you could never have been ſo wicked, you could never have been ſo hardned, againſt God, as you are; hardned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt converſion, hardned againſt repentance, if the Devil had not been dealing with you. You ſee what hard hearts you have; we cannot humble you, we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to repent and turn, our words do nothing with you; you will not be perſwaded to return, but you go on your way, and remain ſtupid, and ſenſleſs of your ſin and miſery; you will not be perſwaded 'tis ſo bad with you. We cannot for our hearts, make you ſenſible of your wretched caſes, nor put a ſtop to you in your ſins; You may ſee well enough who hath been dealing with you, that you continue ſo ſinful ſtill, and ſo hardned in your ſins; It is the Devil that hath had to do with you, thus to deprave you, and to harden you; as ſure as the Devil hath been dealing with ſinners, ſo ſure hath Chriſt been dealing with his Saints. 'Tis not Miniſters that have awakened you, that have convinced and humbled you, and brought you about to the Lord, 'tis Chriſt that hath done theſe things for you. We could never have humbled you, we could never have perſwaded, nor turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor reconciled you to God, if Chriſt himſelf had not done it. You were once <hi>fooliſh and diſobedient, led about
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48705:122"/>
with diverſe luſts;</hi> you were once Drunkards, Liars, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and Prophane, and you had been amongſt this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed Crew to this day, if Chriſt had not fetched you off; 'tis with him you have had to do, as 'tis ſaid, Heb. 4.13. <hi>All things are naked and open before his eyes (with whom we have to do).</hi> You have to do with Chriſt, Chriſt hath been dealing with you that are Chriſtians, or you had never come to this, you had never been theſe liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls; you had never known what you do of God, nor known what you do of Sin, nor been waſhed from your ſins; your had never been here praying, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praiſing the Lord, and become followers of the Lamb, if Chriſt had not had to do with you. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly you that are Chriſtians, there have been great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions betwixt God and your Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In point of Covenant.</hi> Behold, you that are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, you are in Covenant with the Lord; by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I may ſay concerning you, as <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 26.17, 18. <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord to be thy God, to walk in his ways and keep his ſtatutes. And the Lord hath avouched thee to be his peculiar People.</hi> You have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched the Lord to be yours, and the Lord hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched you to be his; a ſolemn and mutual Covenant hath there paſſed, between the Lord and you; he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your Covenant God, you are become his Covenant People; How came this to paſs? how is it, that you are not ſtill as poor ſinners are, in Covenant with Death, and Agreement with Hell? how comes it to paſs, that when poor ſinners are in Covenant with the Devil, you are in Covenant with God? O you may thank Chriſt for this, he hath been effectually dealing with you in this thing. He hath not only procured ſuch a gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a Covenant of Mercy, a Covenant of Pardons, a Covenant of Peace, but he hath alſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Made offer of this Covenant of God to you; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting you to come and joyn your ſelves to the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall never be forgotten.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath made void your Covenant with Death, and diſanull'd your Agreement with Hell. He hath given you an heart to break and make void that wicked Covenant; to break with the Devil, to break with Sin and the World, and to come out from among them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:48705:123"/>3. He hath effectually perſwaded you into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God. He hath brought <hi>you into the bond of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Ezek.</hi> 20.37. He hath ſprinkled you with the Blood of the Covenant, and hath gained your hearty acceptance of all this. You have opened your Mouth to the Lord, you have vowed your ſelves, you have ſworn your ſelves his Covenant Servants; not with your Mouths only, not in profeſſion only, but you have <hi>engaged your hearts to the Lord. Jer.</hi> 30.21. Your Hearts are no longer your own, you have given them to the Lord, to be his for ever. So that you can now ſay, through Grace to the Lord, what he ſaid to <hi>Iſrael. Iſ.</hi> 54.20. <hi>The Mountains ſhall depart, and the Hills ſhall be removed, but through the</hi> help of God, <hi>my faithfulneſs ſhall not depart, nor ſhall the Covenant of my peace ever be removed.</hi> His I am, and through his Grace I am determined to be the Lords for ever.</p>
            <p>Friends, ſuch a ſolemn and ſacred Covenant tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath there been in thoſe very Hearts of yours, betwixt the Lord and you. He hath avouched himſelf to be yours, and you have avouched your ſelves to be his own; and thoſe Hearts of yours, are the Records wherein this Tranſaction is regiſtred, and kept. Remember, and look back and conſider, if there have not been ſuch mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual engagements paſſed betwixt the Lord and you. Look into your Cloſets, and remember what of this kind hath paſſed between him and you in ſecret, look back to your Sacraments, and remember what Covenanting have been between the Lord and you at his Table; and what ſolemn ſealing there hath been, God ſealing to you, and you ſealing back to him. Your Hearts are the Records, wherein theſe Sacred Tranſactions have been Regiſtred; look into thine Heart, doth not this teſtifie for thee, how thou haſt bound thy ſelf to be the Lords for ever, and haſt accepted of his Bond to thee? The remembrance of this Covenant Tranſaction, will be of uſe to you as long as you live; will be of uſe to comfort you in the day of your doubts and fears, to confirm you in the day of Temptations, to hold you cloſe to the Lord, according to the Vows that are upon you, to quicken you and hold you on in that way of holy and lively Obedience, which you have covenanted for. When you grow cold and careleſs and remiſs in your way of Religion, then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Is this the Life I covenanted with God to live? When
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48705:123"/>
you are tempted to decline to a worldly life, or a fleſhly life, then remember, I have promiſed to the Lord, that I will never return to ſuch a life again. When you are out of heart, and complain of weakneſſes and want of ſtrength, and ſo are diſcouraged and diſheartned, I ſhall never be able to hold to ſuch an induſtrious life, then remember the Covenant of the Lord with you; who hath ſealed to you, that he will help you and never fail you, nor forſake you; when your fleſh and your heart fail you, he will be the ſtrength of your heart. When you are in doubts and fears, that you are none of the Lords, nor can lay any claim to him, then remember the Covenant which hath been made between him and you, and how you own it, and ſtand to it to this day, and that may ſatisfie you. Of ſuch great uſe will this Covenant of God be to you, and therefore your hearts, which are the Records where it is kept, muſt be carefully looked to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In point of Communion.</hi> There have been great deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings between Chriſt and you, in a way of Friendly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. What Correſpondencies have there been held betwixt Chriſt and you? what friendly interviews have there been between you? Chriſt hath been often looking down upon you, and rejoycing in his portion, and you have been often looking up to him, and ſolacing your ſelves in his love; Chriſt hath been ſupporting and ſuſtaining your hearts, and you have been ſtaying and leaning upon your beloved. What mutual entercourſes have there been? Chriſt hath been often ſending down Meſſages of love to you; telling you, Soul I am thine; Hath he never ſent thee ſome tokens of his love? ſent thee thy pardon, ſent thee his peace? hath he never ſent thee down ſome taſtes of the <hi>hidden Manna,</hi> and the <hi>white ſtone,</hi> and the <hi>new name?</hi> Rev. 2.17. and ſuch a comfortable word with it, Soul <hi>be of good comfort, thy ſins be forgiven thee,</hi> thy name is written in heaven. And do you never ſend up to your beloved? If you have nothing but a <hi>ſigh</hi> to ſend, or a <hi>tear</hi> to ſend, yet up it muſt be ſent to your beloved, to tell him, I <hi>am ſick of love,</hi> or at leaſt, <hi>I am ſick for love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How often hath thine heart aſcended in Prayers, and his heart deſcended in gracious returns? what mutual embraces have there been, of thy Faith with him, and his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48705:124"/>
love with thee? There hath been a <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder ſet up betwixt Chriſt and thee.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, Such experiences I hope ſome of you have had, of ſuch comfortable Communion with Chriſt. But what becomes of all theſe bleſſed Experiences? haſt thou forgotten them? are they loſt? O how haſt thou kept thine heart? ſure ſuch Mercies ſhould be carefully recorded, and the record ſhould be warily kept.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is the Cabinet of all our Jewels.</hi> Chriſt and all his Graces are kept in the heart.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt and his Graces are jewels.</hi> Chriſt is a precious Jewel, he is <hi>the pearl of great Price,</hi> which the wiſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, Mat. 13.46. traded for; and is there ſaid to be a Pearl of great price; of ſo great a price, that this one Pearl bought the whole World. Its intimated Mat. 16.26. that one Soul is more worth than all the World; this Pearl is more north than a whole World of Souls. It hath bought not only this world below, but the World above; <hi>this one pearl hath bought the whole Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all the everlaſting treaſures,</hi> the everlaſting joy and pleaſures above, that <hi>exceeding eternal weight of glory,</hi> all hath been bought by this Pearl. Chriſt is reckon'd by fooliſh ſinners, at a very low rate; <hi>Judas</hi> ſold this Pearl for thirty pieces of ſilver; Sinners, many of them ſell Chriſt at a lower rate than this, for their fooliſh and fleſhly Luſts. They tread this Pearl in the duſt and take very dung in its ſtead. The very dung of their filthy Pleaſures is that which ſinners take in Exchange for Chriſt. <hi>Whilſt the Apoſtle counted all things dung in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Chriſt, ſinners make very dung of Chriſt, for the ſake of their ſins;</hi> but whatever ſinners count him, Chriſt is a Pearl, more worth then all the world; and all the Glory and Bravery and Beauty of the World, are but Dunghil things, in compariſon of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt, ſo all the Graces of Chriſt are jewels. Faith is a jewel called 2 Pet. 1.1. <hi>Precious Faith.</hi> Meekneſs and Humility are jewels, of great price in the ſight of God. Love is a jewel, and of ſo great price, that it is not to be bought for Money. Cant. 8.7. <hi>If a man would give all the Subſtance of his houſe for love, it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</hi> As little reckoning as ſinners make of the love of God now; though this Grace be offered them, and they may have it for the taking; an heart to love the Lord, is
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48705:124"/>
one of the branches of the Covenant, which the Lord freely offers to ſinners, yet now they ſo ſlight it that they will not accept it; a luſt is taken up in ſtead of this love; yet hereafter theſe very ſinners, would give all that ever they have for the leaſt grain of the ſaving love of God. As little as you regard the love of God now, we can't perſwade you to accept it, yet when you come to die, there's none of you, but would give all that ever you are worth, for a little ſincere love to Chriſt. O now for a little Faith! O now that I could <hi>love the Lord Jeſus in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity!</hi> I would be content to be a beggar, and not to have a Mite left me in all the World; all my Farmes, all my Oxen, all my Houſes and Lands, all my Money, all the ſubſtance of mine Houſe, they ſhall all go, ſo that I might now find the ſaving love of God in me. No, they will not be bought ſo; If a man would give his houſe full of Gold for it, it would be contemned, as a poor and low price to buy love. The like may be ſaid of every Grace, they are all <hi>Jewels,</hi> and they make thoſe who have them to be Jewels. Mal. 3.17. <hi>in the day that I make up my jewels.</hi> Every gracious Soul is a Jewel in the ſight of God. Sinners tread the Saints under feet, make very dirt of them, but God will take them into his boſom as his precious Jewels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Jewels, Chriſt and his Graces, are all kept in the heart. As the Heart is the Seat of Grace, Faith dwells in the heart, and Love dwells in the heart, and Hope dwells in the heart, ſo is it alſo the ſeat of Chriſt; Chriſt <hi>dwells in the heart by Faith,</hi> intimated in that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Apoſtle. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. If Chriſt hath any dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſinners, 'tis only in their Mouths and upon their Lips; theſe will talk of Chriſt, and talk of Grace, but they have no dwelling in them, but upon their Tongues; but it is in the heart of the Saints, that Chriſt and his Graces dwell; Col. 1.27. <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of Glory.</hi> The heart of Saints is as the Heavens, all beſpangled with theſe beautiful Stars. Chriſt is the Sun in thoſe heavens, his Graces are as ſo many Stars, that have their brightneſs and luſtre from his light. The hearts of ſinners are meer Dungeons, and dark holes, in which neither Sun nor Star appears; if there be any glimmering light, they are but Commets, or Torches, or ſtinking Snuffs, that they take for Star-light. Sinners, whatever bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48705:125"/>
or beauty there be in any of your Faces, whatever Gaudy or merry Outſides you have, yet what an inſide have you, your hearts are all dark holes, where dwells every abominable thing; Toads and Serpents, <hi>Zim</hi> and <hi>Jim,</hi> Owles and Satyrs, and every unclean thing dwells within you. Thou that haſt the faireſt outſide, there are Toads and Serpents and Worms crawling and breeding in thine heart. You would every one of you be afraid of your ſelves, you would loath your ſelves, and you would tremble at your ſelves, you would (if you knew how) run away from your ſelves in a fright, if you knew what were in your hearts. Sinners care not to look into their hearts, and ſome of them are afraid to look inwards; and well enough you may, you would ſee ſuch ugly and monſtrous Sights, as might even ſcare you out of your Wits. Saints have all their Riches within them, they have a treaſure in their hearts. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart,</hi> Mat 12.35. There may be, and often is, poverty without, but there's a treaſure within; the richeſt of ſinners they have all their Treaſures without them; in their houſes, in their Purſes, in their ſhops, in their Cheſts, but all the while, there's poverty and beggery in their hearts. Thou art a very beggar, Sinner, with all thy load of Wealth; 'tis a poor beggarly Soul thou haſt, how richly ſoever thy Carcaſe be provided for. 'Tis the heart of the Saints, where God beſtows all his Riches.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, Look to your hearts; you carry more riches in you then the whole World is worth; you looſe all that ever you are worth if you looſe your hearts. He that hath a Treaſure in his houſe, will look more carefully, to the locking of his doors; eſpecially the room where his Riches lye muſt be moſt fortified with Bolts and Bars. You have more to looſe than the Princes of the Earth, and therefore have the more reaſon to keep thoſe hearts wherein all your riches lye. Not only your graces, but your good works, are all kept in your hearts. If ever you have done any good in all your lives, whereof you hope for a reward in the other World; all your Duties, the holineſs and fruitfulneſs of your Converſation, your works of Righteouſneſs, your works of Mercy, theſe are all kept in your hearts. Conſcience is the keeper of them, the Conſcience of an honeſt holy gracious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life, is a precious Treaſure kept within you.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48705:125"/>
2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience</hi>—. All your Duties ariſe from your hearts, all your Holineſs and Fruitfulneſs and activity for God, are ſo many holy ſtreams, flowing from an holy heart; and all theſe ſtreams return into the heart, there they muſt be kept againſt the day of Accounts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is the Ark of your strength.</hi> Some mens ſtrength lies in their heads, in their Wiſdom and Counſel, and Policy; a wiſe man is a ſtrong man. Other mens ſtrength lies in their hands, a Princes ſtrength lies in his Armies, in his Forts and Caſtles and ſtrong Towers; but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſtrength is in his heart. The Lord is in his heart, and Pſal. 73.26. <hi>Thou art the ſtrength of mine heart.</hi> Eph. 6.10. <hi>Be ye strong in the Lord; and in the power of his might,</hi> The weakeſt Chriſtians have a ſtrong God, and hence it is they are ſtrong and of good courage.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians have need of ſtrength;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Of Strength for their Work,</hi> there are great things they have to do; they have much work, hard ſervice; the life of a Chriſtian is not a toying but a toyling life. You ſhall never get to Heaven by play, or by Idleneſs, you have much buſineſs lying upon you, and great buſineſs. The working out your Salvation is hard work. The Soules of Sinners lye idle, as if they had nothing to do. What pains doſt thou uſe to take for thy Soul? What haſt thou done all thy life long, towards the working out thy Salvation? Sinners, you live as if God ſhould throw in Heaven upon you, and cloath you with Glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, whilſt your Souls are faſt aſleep; no you muſt work if you will live; you muſt <hi>labour for the meat that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures to eternal life,</hi> Joh. 6.27. if ever you will have the eating of it. You muſt pray, and watch and <hi>ſtrive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> if ever you will get in. This ſhould be your work, and it is the work of Chriſtians; and for this their great work, they have great ſtrength given them, and all their ſtrength is in their hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſtians have need of ſtrength <hi>for their burthens,</hi> Chriſtians have hard work, and heavy burthens lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Beſides the Care that is upon them for their Souls, which is a great and weighty burthen, and their fear of miſcarrying in the matters of their Souls, which is another burthen; they have burthens of Sufferings, and Afflictions, ordinarily upon their backs. All the hatred
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48705:126"/>
and malice, all the ſcorns and reproaches of this Evil World, light and lie upon the backs of poor Chriſtians, and how ſhall they bear their burthens if they have no ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They have need of Strength <hi>againſt their Enemies.</hi> Chriſtians live in the midſt of Enemies; Enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, the Devil and his Inſtruments; Enemies within, their own Luſts and Corruptions; and they muſt be in continual fight againſt theſe Enemies; and their Enemies being ſo many, and ſo ſtrong, they have need of ſtrength to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians have need of ſtrength, and ſtrength they have, and all their ſtrength is in their hearts. There their Armour lies; <hi>The ſhield of Faith, the breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, the helmet the hope of Salvation;</hi> and there their Captain dwells; the Captain of their Salvation lodges in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Loſe your hearts, and loſe your ſtrength, and what will you do at your Work? how will you bear your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens? how will you ſtand againſt your Enemies, when your ſtrength is loſt? What became of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when he was deprived of that, wherein his ſtrength lay? what weakly Souls are careleſs Chriſtians? every little duty is too hard them; how quickly are they weary? weary of Praying, weary of Hearing, weary of Meditation, weary of a watchful Life; a little work will make them weary. How little can they do, and how little can they bear? every little croſs ſinks their ſpirits; and what reſiſtance can they make againſt Enemies? every luſt is apt to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them away, every Temptation overcomes them. O Chriſtians, by how ſlow a pace do we keep on our way? how little ſign do we make at our work? we have been Chriſtians ſome of us, of twenty years ſtanding or more; how little good have we done, how little treaſure have we gotten in, how little execution have we done upon our ſins and luſts, what poor weakly, lifeleſs, half-ſtarv'd Souls have we to this day? ſure we have been ill keepers of our hearts; the ark of our ſtrength hath been laid waſte, ſtrangers have gotten in and devoured our ſtrength, whilſt we have loytered and ſlept. Friends, do not lye down and idly complain, I am weak, I am a poor feeble ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> I cannot do the things that I would, I cannot pray, I cannot hear, I cannot live but at a ſad, and halting, and

            <p n="6">6. <hi>In your hearts are preſerved all your evidences for heaven.</hi> This follows from the former. What are our Evidences for Heaven but the being of Chriſt, and the Graces of Chriſt in us? your ſincerity in the Covenant, your having your Converſations in all good Conſcience, prove that Chriſt is in you, and you thereby prove that you ſhall hereafter be with him. Prove that you have <hi>Grace</hi> and you thereby prove that you ſhall have <hi>Glory.</hi> Prove that you are in Covenant with God, and walk before him, in all good Conſcience, and that will prove that <hi>your names are written in heaven.</hi> And whether muſt you look for all this, but into your hearts? there as I told you, is a record kept of your Covenant and your Conſcientious Life, and theſe are the Rooms where you muſt look to find Chriſt and his Grace.</p>
            <p>The Devil will tell ſinners, that they ſhall all to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and to make them believe it, will provide them evidences, ſuch as they are; but they are falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evidences. Thou art a Chriſtian, thou haſt been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the name of Chriſt, thou attendeſt on the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt, thou goeſt to hear and to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore thou needeſt not fear, but thou ſhalt to heaven. But let ſinners look but into their hearts, where all good evidences are kept, and there they can find nothing; there's no Chriſt within them, no love to Chriſt, none of the holineſs of Chriſt; their heart is a meer Hell, full of Darkneſs, Ignorance, Unbelief, Enmity againſt Chriſt,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48705:127"/>
and his holy ways. As Chriſtians Evidences for Heaven, ſo Sinners Evidences for Hell are moſtly in their hearts. Whatever your hopes are, if you would look into, if you could ſee what hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sinners Evidences for Hell are in their hearts; and ſuch evidences they might find, as would kill all their hopes of Heaven. But Chriſtians Evidences for Heaven are in their hearts, the Devil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let thine heart be carefully kept, and thou mayſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Devil; None of his? whoſe is this name that is written in my heart? whoſe image are theſe Graces of my heart? I find the Faith of Chriſt in me, the love of Chriſt in me, the very life of Chriſt in me; Chriſt hath ſent me many a token of his love, which I ſtill keep by me; I remember what hath paſſed between Chriſt and me; I have given my ſelf to Chriſt, I have laid hold on his Covenant, and have bound my ſelf in Covenant to him, and I ſtand to that Covenant to this day. And there's my Conſcience alſo within me, bearing me witneſs, that my care and endeavour hath been to walk before him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant of my God; and therefore go on to lie thus unto me while thou wilt, Sathan, I will not believe thee; I believe God, who hath ſaid, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, and walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit;</hi> and I will not bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Friends, if you look well to your hearts, and keep the records clear, this will be your benefit; whatever fears the Devil raiſes, 'tis but looking inwards, and there you will ſee that which will turn all your Fears into lively
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48705:127"/>
Hopes. But if you look not to your hearts, and keep them clean, you will be at a perpetual loſs; you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver long know what to make of your ſelves, nor what is like to become of you. <hi>Aſſurance neceſſarily depends on watchfulneſs,</hi> never look for a grounded peace without it; and never truſt to that confidence, or aſſurance you ſeem to have, whilſt you are of a careleſs heart. Whatever progreſs you have hitherto made in Religion, whatever experiences you have formerly had, of the workings of the Spirit of Grace in you, a carelſs heedleſs Spirit will ſo darken all your Experiences, and blot your Evidences, and leave you under ſuch uncertainties, that for ought you know, you may be damned at laſt. As ever therefore you would maintain an abiding Aſſurance, that its well with you at preſent, and ſhall be well with you hereafter, be watchful over your hearts, that Record of all your Evidences. The reaſon why we are at ſuch uncertainties, and ſo full of our doubts and fears, it lies all here; in our careleſneſs of our hearts. And yet who will take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? O friends, ſtedfaſtly reſolve, through the Grace of God, I will look better to it. Since my heart can never comfort me, unleſs I watch it more narrowly, mine eye ſhall be upon mine heart Night and Day. I will commit my ſelf to the keeper of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and I will ſet my ſelf to keep whatever good thing he hath committed unto me.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>It is a ſacrifice for God.</hi> Pſal. 51.17, <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the heart that is a Sacrifice for God, therefore Prov. 23.26. <hi>Give me thine heart.</hi> It is the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> all the Sacrifices of God is the Sacrifice of the heart. There are other Sacrifices, but whatever they be, 'tis the heart that makes them ſuch. Prayer is a Sacrifice, Pſal. 141.2. <hi>Let my prayer come before thee as incenſe and the lifting up of mine hands, as an evening ſacrifice.</hi> Praiſe is a Sacrifice; Pſal. 50.14. <hi>Offer up to God thanksgiving.</hi> Almes are a Sacrifice; Heb. 13.16. <hi>With ſuch ſacrifices God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> But what maimed Sacrifices are all theſe, if offered up without an heart. What is Prayer without an heart? what is Praiſe; what are Alms, when the heart is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up with them? they are heart Prayers, and heart Praiſes, and heart Alms, that are ſuch Sacrifices, with which God is well pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:48705:128"/>2. What kind of heart it is, that is a Sacrifice to God. A broken or a wounded heart. The broken heart is the only ſound heart. The wounding of the heart is as the lancing of the Impoſtume, it lets out the corruption, and leaves it a ſound heart. The hard heart is a Sacrifice for the Devil; with ſuch Sacrifices, with hard and unbroken hearts, the Devil is well pleaſed. Is thy heart an hard heart, and wilt thou thus give it up to God? Get it to be broken, or thou mayeſt as well carry it to the Devil for a Sacrifice. The Devil loves an hard heart, but it is an abomination to the Lord. An hard heart is an unclean beaſt, which is not for Sacrifice. All the filthineſs and rottenneſs of the heart lies baked up together, in an hard heart; 'twill never be gotten out, 'till the heart be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. In the Law, the Sacrifices were to be without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, Lev. 22.20, 21, 22. <hi>Whatſoever hath a blemiſh, that ſhall ye not offer.</hi> It ſhall be perfect and without blemiſh. Whatſoever is blind, or maimed, or having a Wenn, or Scurvy, or Scabed, ye ſhall not offer. The unbroken heart, is an heart full of Blemiſhes, Wens and Ulcers; a Scurvy and a Scabed heart; 'tis the wounded or broken heart, that is the perfect heart, or an heart without blemiſh.</p>
            <p>Now herein you ſee, both the neceſſity of looking to your hearts, and what it is that you muſt ſecure your hearts againſt; from all things, that may be a blemiſh to the heart; from all thoſe Malladies and Diſeaſes, that will be a blemiſh to the heart; that ſo you do not Sacrifice to God a corrupt thing. Mal. 1.14. <hi>He that ſacrificeth to God a corrupt thing, curſed be that deceiver.</hi> A ſacrifice without an heart is a lame and maimed thing, a ſacrifice from a polluted heart is the ſacrifice of a corrupt thing.</p>
            <p>Beloved, you come with your offerings to the Lord, but what have you to offer? O you have prayers and praiſes to offer up, but is there an heart in your prayers, an heart in your Praiſes, and is it a perfect and upright heart, an heart without blemiſh?

            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> There is a double perfection, a double cleanneſs of heart.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Legal, and ſo that only is a perfect heart, that fully anſwers the Righteouſneſs of the Law, or firſt Covenant; that only, in this ſenſe, is a perfect heart, which hath nothing of Evil or Hypocriſie; no ſpot or blemiſh at all in it, that the ſtricteſt Juſtice could be offended at; thus there's not a man in the World can ſay, mine heart is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, mine heart is a clean heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Evangelical, Such a perfection, which the new Covenant accepts, uprightneſs; a ſincere heart is in a Goſpel Senſe, a perfect heart. An heart that hath been broken by the Word of Chriſt, and been purged by the bloud of Chriſt; an heart that is a purging and cleanſing daily, that hath its great ſpots and blemiſhes of unbelief and impenitence purged away, and hath no ſpots, but are begun to be purged, and are cleanſing dayly.</p>
            <p>Now an heart that hath been thus initially purged and cleanſed, will unleſs it be carefully looked to, contract new ſpots; the impoſthume will gather and feſter again, the Leproſie will fret and eat deeper and deeper into it; longer than the purging work is carried on, the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work will be carrying on. If the wounds of the heart be not carefully kept open, the Devil will quickly heal it up; his hardning is his healing the heart. He will be ſearing the heart ſo, as that though there be never ſo much wickedneſs in it, it ſhall not be felt and perceived; and when we ceaſe to feel our ſores, when the heart grows ſenſeleſs of its ſins, then is a time, when iniquity is like to abound. And there's no way in the World to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this increaſe of our corruptions, and hardning our hearts under it, but by keeping a conſtant Guard upon them, the Devil will be doing, ſin will be working and growing upon us, if there be not a conſtant watch kept.</p>
            <p>And what will ye do then for a Sacrifice for God? wherewithal will you come before the Lord, and bow your ſelves before the moſt high God, if you have not an heart, a clean heart, a perfect and upright heart, that he will accept? As you would be loth that God ſhould meet

you in all your Duties; your praying and hearing and praiſing his Name, and ſay unto you, as to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Iſa. 1.11. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacrifices? when you come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hands, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, your incenſe is an abomination to me. Your Sabbaths, your coming to the Aſſemblies I cannot away with, it is ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity even your ſolemn meeting.</hi> Your meetings my Soul hateth, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them; and when you ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you. Yea when you make many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I will not hear. Friends, would you have the Lord thus to ſpeak to you? Is this all the entertainment and acceptance you would have? when you come together to pray, and to hear, would you have the Lord to ſay, I am weary of this People, I am weary of theſe meetings, my Soul hateth this praying, and this hearing? Doubtleſs this will be all the entertainment you will have, whilſt you come hither and bring not your <hi>hearts</hi> for a Sacrifice, yea, and that broken hearts, hearts without guile, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and perfect in the ſight of God; and ſuch hearts you will never bring, unleſs you will take more care and pains about them; and therefore I exhort you, as the Prophet goes on, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings;</hi> ſo alſo, watch ye, keep ye clean, prevent the return of your evils upon you. And then I ſhould be bold to add as <hi>ver.</hi> 18. to call upon you, and encourage you in the Name and the Words of the Lord, <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Let your hearts be thus kept, and then come; come with your prayers, come with your praiſes and I will hear and accept you.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>It is the Temple of the Lord.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>Ye are the temple of the living God.</hi> 'tis the heart eſpecially, that is this Temple.</p>
            <p>There are four things in the Temple of God, which are ſo many reaſons, why our hearts ſhould be carefully kept, and guarded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The law of God is in his Temple.</hi> The law was read in the Temple, and kept in the Temple; and as in that Temple made with hands, ſo in that living Temple, made without hands, the Law of God is placed and preſerved. Chriſtians have the Law of God within them, their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48705:129"/>
in their hearts; in the heart of a Chriſtian is the Copy of the Bible. God hath not only preach'd it to their hearts, but they have laid it up in their hearts. Pſal. 119.11. <hi>I have hid thy word within mine heart that I might not ſin againſt thee. Mary</hi> kept the ſayings of Chriſt and laid them up in her heart: <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.51. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, Jer. 31.33. <hi>I will write my Law in their hearts:</hi> and he hath done what he promiſed; he that once wrote his Law in Tables of Stone, hath alſo written it in fleſhly Tables of Hearts. Therefore Pſal. 40.8. <hi>Thy Law is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mine heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law written in the heart Notes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All thoſe holy Notions of God,</hi> of Chriſt, of Glory, Honour, Immortality, of the Power, Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and of the Miſtery of Chriſt, which are written in the Scriptures are revealed in the heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All thoſe holy Principles or divine Axioms,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Mercy, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Sobriety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the nature and neceſſity of them, to true Godlineſs and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That Law of the Spirit of life, which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the new Law, or Covenant of Grace, by which we are freed from the Law of ſin and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. the Tenour and the Terms of the Covenant, the Promiſes and the Conditions of the Covenant; the great Charter of the Saints, which gives them Title to, and will give them an entrance into the Everlaſting Kingdom. The writing that Law is the writing the new Covenant in the heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That inward living Law,</hi> the holy bent, inclinations, diſpoſitions begotten in the heart, by the Word, and Spirit of the Lord; that renewed Conſcience, inwardly obliging and holding the heart, to the Obedience of the Word. A Chriſtian hath not only ſomething without him, but ſomething within him, binding him to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; whereby it may be ſaid, much more of him, then of thoſe Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He is a law to himſelf.</hi> His own heart holds him in to Chriſt, his own heart holds him on in Obedience to the Goſpel. If all our Bibles ſhould be loſt, or burnt, if all our Preachers, that urge and preſs our Obedience, were laid aſide and trodden under foot, a Chriſtian hath that within him, that would hold him on in his Chriſtianity. That knowledge of God, and thoſe Principles of Chriſtianity, that love of Chriſt,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48705:130"/>
and that renewed Conſcience within him, will keep him a Chriſtian ſtill.</p>
            <p>Now all this treaſure, thoſe holy Notions, holy Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, this Law of Grace, and this living law of the new Covenant being all kept in the heart; the heart being the Temple of God, wherein all this is preſerved, had need be carefully kept. Would you not have all the Notions of God, and the knowledge of Chriſt dimm'd, and darkned, and razed out? would you not looſe all your holy Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Righteouſneſs and Honeſty of Temperance and Sobriety? would you not have the book of the Covenant ſtolen away, on which all your Hopes and Expectations, all your title to Everlaſting bleſſedneſs depends? would you not looſe that holy bent, and thoſe holy incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and that renewed Conſciences, by all which you are diſpoſed, and inwardly bound, bound in Spirit to the life of Chriſtianity, would you not that all theſe ſhould be loſt? would you not return to be dim ſighted, and dark Souls? would you not exchange your holy Principles, for carnal Principles, your renewed purged Conſciences, for corrupt Conſciences? would you not that the Temple of the Lord be robb'd? would you not that your heart be robb'd of all theſe Treaſures? then ſet a Guard upon your hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The name of God is in his Temple.</hi> Jer. 7.10, 12. 'tis ſaid often, <hi>he places his name there.</hi> And of theſe living Temples, the hearts of Saints, 'tis ſaid, Rev. 3.12. <hi>I will write the name of my God, and the name of the City of my God upon them.</hi> And Chap. 2.17. in this heart, there is a precious ſtone put, and upon this ſtone a new name written, which no man knows but he that hath it. A Chriſtian hath not only the names of Chriſt call'd upon him, he is call'd a Chriſtian, after the name of his Lord; but he hath this name written upon him, written upon his heart. Sure that Table ſhould be kept clean in which is written ſuch a precious name. What ſhall the name of God be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on a dunghil? wilt thou ſuffer Sin and the Devil to make a very dunghil of thy heart, and in that dunghil write the name of thy God? If the heart be not well guarded, the Devil will be not only carrying out, but carrying in all the precious Treaſures that are in your hearts, let Satan alone a while, and hee'l carry them all away; Whatever thou haſt now, thou ſhalt have nothing of God left in thee,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48705:130"/>
nothing of Chriſt leſt in thee; none of all thy Graces, none of all thy comforts. Haſt thou love for Chriſt, haſt thou hope in Chriſt, haſt thou peace or joy in God, haſt thou either the image or the comforts of God in thee? Satan ſtands ready, if thou look not to him, to carry all away; thou wilt quickly be left a very miſerable Soul, poor and blind and naked, if thou take not heed. And as the Devil will be <hi>carrying out,</hi> ſo he will be alſo, <hi>carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in,</hi> to that heart of thine. Thy Gold and thy Jewels he will carry away, and he will bring in dirt, and filth, and traſh. As he unloads thee, he will load thee; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load thee of the treaſures of light, and load thee with the treaſures of darkneſs. He will fill thoſe hearts with every unclean thing, he will make thoſe Temples to be very Stables, or Sties; he will make that heart a very Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil; and Chriſt muſt either have no name within thee, or that precious name written on a dunghil; and will you ſuffer ſuch an affront and abuſe to be put upon your Lord? If you do not keep your hearts, ſo it will be.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Worſhip of God is in his Temple. Mine houſe ſhall be called an houſe of Prayer.</hi> Mat. 21.13. In this inward Temple, the heart, is the inward and ſpiritual Worſhip of God. The people of God, are ſaid to be the People that <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit,</hi> Phil. 3.3. There are great thoughts of heart, and many Scruples, ariſing about the outward Worſhip of God; about the keeping that pure, about the clearing and ſecuring of that, againſt the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Inventions, and corrupt mixtures of humane Impoſitions. And 'twere happy if the Houſes of God in the Land, were ſwept cleaner, and kept cleaner from theſe than they are. But the main of our care lies not here; theſe are not the great things we are concern'd to take care about. If outward Ordinances were never ſo purely adminiſtred, and kept never ſo free from adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating mixtures, there's a greater thing then this, that lies upon us; that the inner Temple be kept pure, that the heart Worſhip be kept pure and intire. The heart alſo is to be an houſe of Prayer, and ſhall we make this houſe of Prayer, a den of Theeves, or an houſe of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize? O what droves of unclean beaſts are let in to theſe hearts of ours! what houſes of Merchandize are theſe houſes of prayer become! theſe Sanctuaries of the Lord are become meer ſhops of buyers and ſellers.

It is a very grievous thing to conſider, how much the [hearts] of Chriſtians are taken up with theſe things; we cannot love the Lord as we ſhould, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mind Glory and Immortality as we ſhould, It is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable praying, lamentable praiſing, or meditating on God that is to be found in us; we are ſo diſordered, diſtracted and confuſed in theſe ſpiritual exerciſes, there is ſuch a mixture of Carnal thoughts; ſuch carnal Affections, worldly Projects and Cares are thruſting in, that corrupt and ſpoil and enervate all our ſpiritual Duties, that we can find nothing but blind and broken and maimed Sacrifices, to offer up unto the Lord.</p>

Worſhip God, come hither as often as you will, God will be weary to meet you here; he hath been waiting from week to week, from Sabbath to Sabbath, to ſee if it may be better, if he could meet with ſuch Sacrifices here, ſuch hearts here as might be pleaſing to him; he hath waited thus ſo long, and ſtill finds ſo little of what he likes, ſo few living Sacrifices; he hath waited ſo long and found ſo little, that 'tis to be doubted, if we continue thus, we may come hither to meet one another, but our God will be weary to give us a meeting. Friends, if you would not that the things that offend in your hearts, ſhould drive God away, then take more heed how you ſuffer theſe offences, or things, to come in, or to lodge any longer in you.</p>

Would you let it lie all dirty, and duſty, hang'd with Cobwebs and Spiders? would you let it lie naſty and filthy, and every thing out of its place and order?

The World ſteals in upon the heart, and it never comes there, but to ſteals away its Treaſure; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis to be obſerved, that the hearts of ſuch Chriſtians, as are moſt poſſeſſed of the World, are ever the moſt poor and beggarly. Never look to find much of Chriſt or his Grace, if any thing at all, where the World hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Poſſeſſion. Chriſt comes into the heart on purpoſe, to carry away the heart from the World; his Word is, where he comes, <hi>give me thine heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. <hi>Love

not the world nor the things of the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15. And the world comes into the heart on purpoſe, to ſteal it away from Chriſt again. There is never any one that embraceth this preſent World, but 'tis to his loſs; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the World brings, it takes away better than it brings. 2 Tim. 4.10. <hi>Demas hath forſaken us and embraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world.</hi> He embrac'd the World, and what got he by it? the ſame day he embraced the World, he forſook Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian, art thou fallen in with the World? Are its gains and its pleaſures gotten into thy heart? doth it fawn and ſmile upon thee, and is thine heart taken and pleaſed with its fawnings? Look to thy ſelf; what haſt thou within thee? haſt thou Grace? haſt thou Peace? does thy Soul flouriſh? for ought I know thou haſt ſeen the laſt of thy good days, what time this World is thus embraced by thee.</p>
            <p>O friends, ſet a watch againſt this Thief, ſet a guard againſt it; <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs,</hi> Luk. 12.15. That's the ſame Counſel, as guard your hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this World. Covetouſneſs is the opening the door to let the world in, nay the world is gotten in already where Covetouſneſs is. Thou which haſt a Covetous heart, thine heart is already poſſeſſed of the world. May be thou haſt yet but a little of it in thine hand, but thine heart is already full of it, the whole world is gotten in, where Covetouſneſs is gotten in.</p>
            <p>Worldly Profeſſors, methinks you ſhould be ſtartled at it, if you conſidered, what a Theif you have within you. Whatever thou ſeemeſt to have of Chriſt, or the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of heaven, thou art like to be but a poor wretch, in a little time.</p>
            <p>And how is it like to be with thee, whoſe heart hath entertained the Pleaſures and the merriments of the world? or the favours and fawnings of the Men of the world? who loveſt to be ſome body with evil men, to have their reſpect and eſteem? he that would fain be ſome body with the world, is like to be no body with Chriſt.

Hath the bloud of Chriſt blotted out the hand-writing that was againſt you? hath the Spirit of Chriſt, engraven a new hand-writing for you? O watch againſt iniquity, which will renew the old hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, and blot out the new.

Pſal. 66.18. <hi>If</hi> I <hi>regard iniquity in my heart God will not hear my prayer.</hi> And what comfort canſt thou have, when thou art become ſuch a one as God will not hear, when thou prayeſt?

But how doſt thou hold up thine head under theſe things? when thou lookeſt into thine heart, how doſt thou find it there? doſt thou not find thy ſins to be blots within thee? doſt thou not find the writing blotted, thine evidences blurr'd, the image of Chriſt defaced, thy comforts vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If thou doſt not, if thou canſt be of good comfort ſtill, if thou art of good chear, and confident ſtill; this comfort, this confidence is not the comfort of God, but falſe and deceitful. Thou may'ſt comfort thy ſelf, and ſpeak peace to thy ſelf ſtill, but miſtake not thy ſelf, God ſpeaks not a word of comfort to thee in ſuch a caſe: if thou hadſt any real comfort before, that thou wilt find all blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the true ſenſe of it utterly loſt.

Whilſt we keep our ſelves pure, the Lord God will delight to take his abode with us; Who is it Chriſtians, you would have to dwell in you? O let me be an habitation for the Lord; let the holy Jeſus, let the holy Spirit dwell in me; none but God, none but Chriſt, thou Lord art mine inhabitant, let me be thy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. Where God dwells, there light dwells, there peace dwells, there hope and joy dwells; I count upon nothing, I have no joy, no hope, no peace, all that I have is loſt, all that I have to comfort me, all that I have to ſtay or ſupport me, all that I have to delight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh me, all is loſt, yea I have loſt my ſelf, when God is departed from me. Do you indeed look upon it, as ſo miſerable a caſe, when the Lord hath forſaken you? then take heed how you defile his habitation. Let wilful ſin in, and that will certainly drive the Lord out; and if you would keep ſin out of the heart, keep it out of your lives. Life ſins are heart blots. Jer 2.22. <hi>Their iniquity is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before me.</hi> And 'tis the heart that bears its black marks upon it.</p>
            <p>O friends, what ſad marks have we upon us! what ſpeckled and ſpotted ſouls have we! how miſerably are our inſides defiled! Minds defiled, Affections defiled, Conſciences defiled? 'tis a ſign what Lives we have lived, 'tis a ſign how well we keep our Garments, how well we keep us from practical iniquity; our heart ſtains, our heart defilements ſhew ſufficiently, how much iniquity hath abounded in us.</p>
            <p>Friends, look inward; ſee what work ſin hath made within you, what a Conſcience hath it left you, what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections hath it left you? how hath it dimm'd and defaced the Image of God in you?

that your only friend and portion and hope is become a ſtranger to you? learn to keep you cleaner if you would have it better; count upon it, there is no hope that God ſhould take pleaſure in you, or give you any pleaſure in him; that God ſhould be a comfort to you, longer then you keep you more pure. Oh get your hearts waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new; we have need of many waſhing dayes, who have ſo many ſinning dayes. Every day ſhould be a waſhing day to us. Take that counſel of the Prophet; Iſa. 1.16. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings.</hi> Make you clean, and keep you clean. Waſh ye and watch ye, put away the evil of your doings, if you would that your hearts ſhould long be kept clean. Waſh your hands and waſh your face, and waſh your feet, or theſe will defile your hearts. Put away the Garment ſpotted with the fleſh, keep your outward man clean, keep you unſpotted from the World, that ſo you may be blameleſs and unreprovable in the ſight of God. O Chriſtians, let us ſtudy every one of us, to get to ſuch a blameleſs and unrebukable Converſation, that not only the world may have nothing to ſpot us with, but that our Conſciences may have nothing to ſpot us with, that our hearts may not have wherewith to reprove us? as little as may be, of the common and unavoidable infirmities of our fleſh; but however we may be overtaken as to theſe, yet be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproveable, as to any tolerated or allowed iniquities; theſe are the great blots wherewith the heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
            <p>Brethren beloved, whoever among you that fear the Lord, I would fain do what I can, to prepare you an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habitation for the holy one; that whereas he hath ſaid 2 Cor. 6.16. I will dwell with them and walk in them, you may be ſuch in whom his Soul may delight to dwell, that he may ſay of you all, as Pſal. 132.14. <hi>This is my reſt for ever here will I dwell for</hi> I <hi>have deſired it.</hi> It is a ſtrange expreſſion; the holy God ſpeaks this to all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones; to thee in particular, to thine heart if it be but a clean heart; the Almighty God ſays to thee, there is my reſt, in that heart of thine will I dwell, for I have deſired it; the Lord God hath a deſire to be thy Gueſt, hath a deſire to that poor Soul of thine, to take it up for his own dwelling. I would that you may be preſented at laſt unſpotted and unreproveable in his ſight, and to this end
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48705:135"/>
that you may be <hi>preſented</hi> holy at laſt, I would that you may be <hi>preſerved</hi> holy and without blame at preſent; O look to thoſe hearts, keep you pure, let there be written upon you, holineſs to the Lord; they ſhould be a little heaven into which nothing that defileth ſhould enter. O purge your ſelves of whatever may offend and then guard your ſelves againſt it. This is my warning to you; and this is my prayer for you, that the very God of Peace, will ſanctifie you wholly, and I pray God that your whole Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Soul and Body may be preſerved blameleſs againſt the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And to him I commend you, who is able to keep you from falling, and to preſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his Glory, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joy, to him be Gloro for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Againſt Diſtempers.</hi> A good temper of heart, will be an advantage to us, in any thing we have to do. An heart out of temper is like a bone out of joint, or like a Tempeſtuous Sea, there's no good ſailing in it. We cannot keep our way, but ſhall be driven about, this way and that way, with every wind and wave. An heart out of temper, is like a door off the hinges, or a Chariot off the Wheels; it draggs and goes untowardly and heavily on.</p>
            <p>O how often are our Souls unhinged, our Chariots off the wheels, or our wheels without oyl, and then what pitiful work do we make, at any thing we have to do! when we have been in a crowd of worldly buſineſs, or been fooliſhly merry and vain, what a diſcompoſure do we find upon our Souls, and how unfit are we then for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? when we come to pray or to hear, what labour doth it coſt us, to reconcile our hearts to our Duties, or to get us into a praying or hearing frame. We come to pray, as a Muſitian comes to play, when his Inſtrument is out of Tune; he muſt ſpend a good deal of his time in tuneing, before one ſtroke can be ſtrook. How much work have we, to tune our hearts at ſuch times, and it may be at laſt, 'tis more then we can do; and ſo we muſt either let the duty alone, or make ſuch ſad melody in the Ears of the Lord, as a Muſitian would do in ours, who ſhould play on his Inſtrument, when every ſtring is out of tune.</p>
            <p>Get your hearts in temper, and keep them ſo. Be able to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7. <hi>O God mine heart is fixed mine heart is fixed;</hi> The good temper of the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48705:136"/>
heart notes, freedom and towardlineſs and diſpoſedneſs, for any thing God calls to, and firmneſs and ſtability in that towardlineſs. Let your hearts be eſtabliſhed in Good. Let there be an abiding holy temper upon your Spirits, ſome of the diſtempers that we ſhould guard our hearts againſt, are</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Slightneſs and vanity of Spirit.</hi> A well tempered heart is a ſerious heart. Seriouſneſs of heart, is as ballaſt to a Ship, we ſhall go ſteadily whilſt our hearts are ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Gird up the loyns of your minds, and be ſober.</hi> Soberneſs here, is the ſame with ſeriouſneſs. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are always engaged about ſerious and weighty things, their Eternity is concern'd in every day they live, and in every thing they do. Every action of our Lives, is a ſtroke at that work, which muſt have an influence upon our Eternal State. We have weighty work lying upon our hands every day, and hour, and how unſuitable is a ſlight and trifling Spirit, to important affairs? a ſlight heart is an empty and ſhallow heart, and a ſhallow heart is unfit to meddle in the deep things of God.</p>
            <p>Watch againſt ſlightneſs of Spirit. Frothineſs and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity becomes not a Chriſtian at any time; we may ſay of the frolicks and light and jovial lives, of the carnal world, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of laughter, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I ſaid of laughter it it is mad.</hi> A Chriſtian is beſides himſelf, when he indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a vain and frothy Spirit. Friends, 'tis not for us to live in jeſt; Eternal Life and Death are no jeſting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; learn to live in good earneſt; thoſe that are light and vain, that are little elſe but froth and vapour, in their ordinary Courſe, do uſe to be but little better in their moſt ſerious Duties. O what ſlight praying is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt us, what ſhallow and empty Duties do our ſlight and trifling hearts ſatisfie themſelves withal? it may be, ſome of us, when we have ſpent a whole Sabbath with the Lord, if we do reflect upon the temper we have been in, may ſometimes find, that we have hardly had a ſerious hour, in a whole day If they ſhould be asked, as Chriſt asked his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.40. <hi>What could ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> what could ye not be ſerious with me, one hour? what could we anſwer? what returns do you think, ſlight and triflling duties are like to have? Look to it, God will give you but a ſlight anſwer, if you be but ſlight in ſeeking. O be ſober, be ſerious; and if you
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48705:136"/>
would be ſerious in your moſt ſolemn duties, get this holy ſeriouſneſs to be your temper. Beware of a vain and frothy habit, habituate your ſelves to Godly ſeriouſneſs; not but that there muſt be at times, ſome little Relaxation, the bow would grow weak, if it ſhould ſtand always bent. But then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Relaxation or remitting the intention of our Spirits, muſt be but ſhort, and no more than neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Never ſuch as to be an hindrance to ſeriouſneſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though I muſt ſometimes unbend, yet I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unhinge my Soul, or disjoint or diſcompoſe it, for its return to its work. We muſt not be of thoſe, whoſe lives be in jeſt, and only now and then a fit of ſeriouſneſs; 'tis thy life, thine ordinary courſe, thine ordinary frame, and only ſome little intervals for Recreation.</p>
            <p>To ſeecure your ſelves againſt the diſtemper of a ſlight and vain Spirit, get a deep and ſtanding ſenſe upon your hearts, of the weight and importance of thoſe great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, that are dayly upon you: look more into Eternity. Remember, you have an immortal God, whoſe eye is always upon you. You have an immortal Soul, that muſt live or die for ever. Your buſineſs in this World, is not to pleaſe your humours, and gratifie your fleſh, and your fancies, but to ſerve the living God; to ſecure this God to your ſelves, to be [your] God; to ſeek your peace and reconciliation with God; and to that end, to make Chriſt the reconciler, ſure to you; to ſerve the Lord Chriſt and hereby to ſecure the Salvation of your Soul.</p>
            <p>Remember that you have this great work lying upon you, and this is not the work of ſome ſhort inches of your time, of an hour in a day, or one day in a week; but that this muſt be your every days work, and your all days work. Think of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, what if I ſhould miſcarry in this great work, if I ſhould loyter out, or laugh out, or trifle out ſo much of my time, that when I ſhall come to die, and away for the other world, I ſhould find that work I liv'd for here, were not done or but half done, or but ſlightly done? if I ſhould then find, that I had been light and vain in my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and but ſlight and ſhallow in my Religion? and whilſt I was allowing my fleſh, what it would have, I cut my Soul ſhort of what it ſhould have had. Death will
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48705:137"/>
make every one of you ſerious, the Grave, when you are ſtepping into it, will make you all in good earneſt. And how would your living in jeſt, or in pleaſant idleneſs, then look upon you? remember theſe things daily; let deep thoughts of them, come daily upon you; and this would put you out of your ſlight and merry tune; the ſenſe of theſe ſerious things would hold you in a ſerious temper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Looſeneſs.</hi> There's a double looſeneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Such as is oppoſite to fixedneſs,</hi> that's the ſame, with <hi>lightneſs and vanity</hi> of heart; a whiffling in and out unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul, a ſlippery heart, that we never know where to have it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as is oppoſite to ſtrictneſs;</hi> that is the ſame with <hi>licentiouſneſs,</hi> and that is it, which I am now to ſpeak to. A Licentious heart is a diſtempered heart. The contrary to this Diſtemper, is the compliance or cloſing of the heart with the Rule, and keeping to it The new heart is made after the pattern of Chriſt its new Lord; there's the ſame Spirit in a Chriſtian, which was in Chriſt; <hi>as he was, ſo are we in this world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.17. His very Spirit and Image is formed upon our hearts. And it is conformed to the new Law or Rule, which Chriſt hath preſcribed to it, and it ſtands determined for ſtrictneſs or exactneſs of walking, according to this rule; whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Gal. 6.16. <hi>As many as walk according to this Rule, peace be unto them.</hi> That is a ſtrict heart, which is determined and diſpoſed to live by Rule. Licentiouſneſs of heart is the hearts allowing and indulging its Liberty, and Latitude in its Courſe. Chriſtianity in general, is that which it takes up, but it will not be held within the limits of it. The ſtrait Gate and the narrow way, is too ſtrait and too narrow for it. That way it pretends to have choſen, but it will be breaking over the hedge, as the Inclinations and Intereſt of the Fleſh lead it. In ſome things a Chriſtian, in other things a Libertine.</p>
            <p>O how much of this Licentiouſneſs of heart, is to be found amonſt Chriſtians! amonſt all the Chriſtians amongſt us, how few exact and ſtrict Chriſtians are there? whoſe hearts determine for exactneſs and ſtrictneſs of life, who impoſe and charge upon themſelves, the whole Rule and the diligent obſerving of every point and tittle of it? ſuch exactneſs in point of Practiſe, we cannot in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate reach unto; <hi>in many things we offend
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48705:137"/>
all.</hi> Jam. 3.2. Our feet ſlip, and our ſteps are turning aſide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; but it is the indulging our ſelves a liberty for this turning aſide, or the hearts not charging ſtrictneſs upon it, that is this Licentiouſneſs of heart.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>gradual</hi> Licentiouſneſs of heart, and there is a <hi>total</hi> Licentiouſneſs. A total Licentiouſneſs is of ſuch, who utterly reject the Yoke of Chriſt, and will not come under his Government, but will reſign up themſelves to Luſt and carnal Inclinations, to command in Chief over them. As thoſe <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Who walked in the lusts of their fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind.</hi> Such Licentious ones are no Chriſtians; if they have the name, yet the heart of a Chriſtian is not found in them. Gradual Licentiouſneſs is, when the heart, though it hath put it ſelf under the Yoke of Chriſt, and reſigned up its ſelf to be governed by him, in oppoſition to the luſts of the fleſh and the World, yet often falls a luſting after that liberty, from the exactneſs and ſeverities of Chriſtianity, which in the general it hath profeſſed to conſent and yeild its ſelf unto. And though the decree of the Soul, for following Chriſt in every thing, be not made void, and utterly broken, yet it is ſo remiſs and weak, that it will not hold it cloſely in; but there is a frequent breaking looſe from the rule, and the heart too often indulgeth its ſelf that liberty: How far forth a Chriſtian may break looſe from the Rule, and how far forth he may indulge and allow himſelf at times, and yet be a Chriſtian ſtill, is not eaſie to determine; but this is certain that every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of this heart looſneſs, is a pernicious diſtemper, that muſt be watched againſt; eſpecially if it riſe ſo high, as that there be a diſlike of ſtrictneſs, and ſuch a groaning under the ſeverities of Religion, as maketh it ſeem a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to it, to be tied up ſo ſhort. The more of this, the higher the Diſeaſe is, and the more to be doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch mens Chriſtianity be ſound. The ſtricteſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is the moſt healthful, and the moſt evidently a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed; and the greater latitude the heart indulges its ſelf to, the more ſickly the Soul is; if it be not quite dead, and no Chriſtian at all.</p>
            <p>Friends, You that are Chriſtians indeed, if you know what you have done, you have vowed the greatneſs ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs poſſible. That is, to preſs on towards it, and to reach out after it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You did not Covenant to follow Chriſt
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48705:138"/>
to ſuch a degree, and no higher; to advance in Religion to ſuch a pitch, and no more; you did not Covenant for thus much Obedience; thus much duty, thus much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, thus much Zeal, and no more; if ye be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed, you have covenanted to follow the Lord fully; to watch to every Duty, to watch againſt every ſin; to preſs on to the higheſt pitch of holineſs, to do to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to pleaſe the Lord. If there were any reſerve, in your vow to Chriſt, of any little liberty to the Fleſh, of any limit of your zeal and care; if there were any ſuch reſerve, you are falſe in your Covenant, and but falſe Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>O friends, have you vowed the greateſt ſtrictneſs? then watch againſt the leaſt degrees of looſeneſs. Get a ſettled Judgment, of the excellency and neceſſity of ſtrictneſs; get an hearty love and good liking of it; let your Souls be bent upon it, let it be your deſire, and your aim, and your hope, and your labour, to hold you cloſe by Chriſt; and if you would not have licentious practiſes abound in your life, let no licentious Principles, no licentious affections neſt themſelves in your hearts; ſee that there be no luſt after any other liberty, then Chriſt hath allowed you. Get to be heartily well pleaſed with all the Laws of Chriſt; with his narroweſt ways; let that latitude of Religion, which is the meaſure of carnal diſciples, be your fear and not your deſire. And if you feel any itch after it, look upon it as a diſeaſe, and diſtemper of your heart. Count thy ſelf but a weakly and ſickly Chriſtian, whilſt is is thus with thee.</p>
            <p>Know that it is your greateſt Excellency; if Holineſs be an Excellency, then the more ſtrictly holy the more Excellent. Yea and you will find it your greateſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the more holineſs the more enlargement of your hearts, to all the holy ways of God. Pſal. 119.44, 45. <hi>I will keep thy law continually,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>I will walk at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;</hi> his meaning was not, I will walk licentiouſly, at liberty from thy Laws, at liberty from Rule; but I will walk freely in thy ways, when thou ſhalt knock off my fetters that hinder me. The more we can hold in, and inure our ſelves, to be punctual in our Religion, the more freedom ſhall we find, and with the more eaſe and delight ſhall we run the way of Gods Commands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:48705:138"/>And know this, that by how much the more looſe you are from the ways of God, by ſo much the more looſe from God; and what will you have to comfort you, what will you have to ſweeten Religion to you, whilſt God is at a diſtance from you? Keep you faſt to him, and you ſhall live the more under his reviving, and refreſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. Religion hath its troubles and its harſhneſs, and you will have little elſe then the harſhneſs of it, longer then you keep you cloſe to the Lord. The Waters of the Sanctuary will taſt but brackiſh to you, longer then the Sun ſhines upon them; a little Sun-ſhine from above, a ſmile from the Face of God, this is the ſweetneſs, this is the Bleſſedneſs. Keep cloſe to God, and you ſhall keep the paſſage clear between Heaven and your Hearts. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will be like <hi>Ephraims</hi> Idolatry. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.7. It will be but <hi>a dry ſtalk, the Bud will yield no Meat.</hi> There will be the Labours of it, and the Troubles of it, but no Meat for your Souls to feed upon, longer then you meet with God in your Duties. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you, Jam.</hi> 4.8. Keep cloſe by God, and he will keep cloſe to you: May be, ſome of you have never yet taſted how Gracious the Lord is, nor will you ever be like to do, if you ſet not in cloſer in his ways. Looſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will keep you ſtill in the dark, and in a weary and uncomfortable State. There's no ſuch way to make Chriſt's ways pleaſant, as by keeping conſtantly in them; no ſuch way to make Chriſts Yoke eaſie, as by holding it cloſe to your Necks; it never ſo galls and wrings, as when it hangs looſely on; reſolve upon ſtrictneſs, and you ſhall taſte the ſweetneſs. Hold you in from running out after the Pleaſures of the Fleſh, and the Face of God will be a pleaſure to you, which the Diſtemper of a looſe and carnal Heart will certainly deprive you of; and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from the reliſh, or finding delight therein.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Liſtleſneſs.</hi> A dull untoward, ſluggiſh, unactive, lifeleſs temper, where the Edge of our Spirits is blunted, inſomuch that whatever opportunities we have, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever calls we have to be doing for God, or our Souls, we have no liſt to them, but through the way-wardneſs and and untowardneſs of our hearts, we let them ſlip, and either do nothing, or nothing to purpoſe. Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are a price put into our hands, but by reaſon of this ſluggiſh, liſtleſs, untoward temper, we have no heart to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48705:139"/>
them; but became like the Fool, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. <hi>In vain is there a price put into the hands of a Fool, which hath no heart to it.</hi> This is a wretched and pernicious Diſtemper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It proceeds from an evil cauſe,</hi> From the carnality of our hearts, and our unſuitableneſs to the work of God. It is ungrateful and unpleaſing work to us; our hearts are ſo contrary to it, we had rather be any where then with God, we had rather be about any work, then the work of our Souls. We can be brisk and ſprightful about our carnal and earthly employments, but for any thing of Religion, there we dragg and go heavily on; we are all Soul and Life, in what we have to do for our Fleſh, but our hearts hang backward, and come but heavily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly on, to do any thing for God. This is from the little intereſt that God hath in our Souls, and the little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we bear to him. We are yet carnal, and that's the reaſon we have ſo little Edge or ſo little liſt to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is an ill ſign.</hi> What ill ſign is it? 'Tis a ſign of want of Grace; either that we have no Grace at all, or at leaſt are but very low in the Grace of God; that our day is yet but a day of ſmall things. Where is our Faith in Chriſt, when we are ſo backward in the work of Faith; As Chriſt ſayd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Wherefore doſt thou doubt</hi> ſo, wherefore doſt thou drag ſo, O thou of little Faith? Where's our Love to Chriſt, when our work for Chriſt goes ſo ſlowly on? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The Love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains us.</hi> The Love of Chriſt will quicken us, the Love of Chriſt will put Life into us; we ſhould find our Tongues, and find our Hands, and find time to be more abundant in ſervice, could we feel more of the Love of Chriſt in us. Thou makeſt nothing of it, that thou art ſuch a dull, untoward, unactive Souls; but is it nothing to want Faith? Is it nothing to want love to Chriſt? Is it nothing to be without Grace in thy heart? Or if thou haſt any to have ſo very little, as thou canſt not tell, whither 'tis any or no? It is an ill ſign, that thy Soul is in a very doubtful caſe, at leaſt 'tis to be doubted; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haſt any Grace in thee, Where in ordinary thou art ſo untoward and liſtleſs to the matters of God, and the buſineſſes of Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:48705:139"/>3. <hi>'Tis of ill conſequence.</hi> 'Tis a ſign our caſe is bad, and it is an hindrance from our growing better. It is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacious active ſtirring ſoul, that's like to be the thriving Soul. Sluggards and Sleepers are never like to come to any thing. We may preach to you while our hearts ake, we may inſtruct you, and tell you what is your duty, while we will, and you may hear us while you will, but in vain ſhall we preach, and in vain will you hear, till we can fire you out of this deadneſs, and whet and ſet an edge upon thoſe blunted Souls what will it be, to be told of your Duty, whilſt you remain to have ſo little heart to it? what becomes of all the Sermons you hear, of all the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, what you ſhould do, and how you ſhould live? what becomes of all the convincing, awakening, quickning words, that are in your ears from day to day? what doth all our Preaching, and all your hearing bring forth upon you? truly friends, the little <hi>ſucceſs</hi> that is to be perceived, of our Preaching among you, either to the <hi>converting</hi> of ſinners, or <hi>improving</hi> of profeſſors; the ſmall ſucceſs that does appear, (what there is within God knows) does even make us out of heart. But as little ſucceſs as we have, we are never like to have it much better, unleſs we may ſtir your hearts, and awaken you to more diligence and activity. When we have done all we can, we are, I doubt, like at laſt, to leave the moſt of you, either <hi>quite dead</hi> in ſin, or but very <hi>Dwarfes</hi> in Religion. Sinners, is it nothing to you, that the enlivening word ſhould leave you ſtill among the dead? Chriſtians, is it nothing to you, that the nouriſhing and quickning Word ſhould leave you but babes and infants? Is it not a trouble to you, and a diſcomfort to you, that you get no more, that you grow no faſter, much more that any of you ſhould conſume and languiſh, under the hands of your Phyſicians? I muſt tell you, it is a diſcomfort to us, but is it not more a diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to you? can you continue at this paſs, and not be troubled at it. <hi>O what a comfort is it to be a thriving live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian?</hi> Methinks, when you ſee any ſuch before your eyes, you ſhould at leaſt ſigh out ſuch a wiſh, <hi>O that it were ſo with me;</hi> and breath out ſuch a groan, <hi>wo is me that 'tis not ſo;</hi> methinks it ſhould be an heavineſs of heart to you, to feel your own ſoul in Cloggs, when you ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the wing; O that I could make you ſenſible of your diſeaſes! that I could preach you heart ſick, that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48705:140"/>
I could but make your hearts ake, under your diſtempers; that you might no longer be able to go up and down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble in this unthriving caſe. Sure friends, you whoſe caſe this is, had need to be troubled; and 'twould be well for you, if your <hi>Souls</hi> were in pain, and <hi>refuſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted</hi> till you be cured.</p>
            <p>To make you yet more ſenſible, of the perniciouſneſs of this untoward dull and liſtleſs temper, look a little more upon the excellency of the contrary; a chearful lively temper. 'Tis call'd 2 Cor. 8.17. A <hi>forward mind.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.2. A <hi>ready mind</hi> that need not be ſpurred, and whip'd, but goes chearfully and freely on its way. What is a ſprightful horſe, to a dull and heavy jade? what is a blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ruſty knife, to that which is bright, and keen? what is a conſumptive languiſhing body, to one that's lively, and healthful? what is a dark and lowring to a Sunſhine day? what is Winter to Summer? yea what are the living to the dead? what a pitiful thing is that dead and ſpiritleſs heart of thine, when thou lookeſt on them in whom is the life of God.</p>
            <p>Hear O ye ſleepy and liſtleſs Souls, awaken, ſtir up your ſelves, ſhake off this ſloth and ſleep, work out this untoward ſpirit. What, do you mean to hang thus betwixt alive and dead? will you hold you at this paſs, till you come to your Graves? Is this all the care and the pains, you ever mean to beſtow on God, and your Souls? muſt the Lord ever find you ſo unready and untoward, to what he calls you to? ſhall the world find a forward mind in you? ſhall your fleſh find ſuch a ready mind, to whatever it hath for you to do, and will you only be unready and unactive for God? Wherefore have you Reaſon and Underſtandings? wherefore have you the Scriptures before you? what are Sabbaths and Ordinances and Miniſters for? muſt we come hither only to ſing you aſleep, or to rock von in your Cradles? Where is that Grace that is in you? where is your Faith? where is your love to Chriſt? where is your hope? if you have any Grace, where is it? what muſt all theſe precious talents be eaten up with ruſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>laid up in a napkin?</hi> Remember the ſlothful Servants doom. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.30. What are your immortal Souls? what is the holy God? what is Jeſus Chriſt? what are the glorious treaſures of Eternity? are all theſe worth no more of your care and induſtry? will none of theſe things move you? will not theſe great things quicken you? Hear them all calling upon you, <hi>God</hi> calls upon you, oh my
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48705:140"/>
children, if you have any reſpect for me, come along, come faſter after me. <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls, oh my Diſciples, if you have any love to me, if all that I have done for you, if all that I will do for you, will move you, ariſe and mend your pace. <hi>Heaven</hi> calls upon you, if ever you mean to come here, gird up your loyns and come on. Yea <hi>Hell</hi> calls, look ye down hither, what a place is here prepared for Sleepers and Loyterers? Your poor <hi>Souls</hi> call, have ye any pity for me? muſt I periſh and die for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this lazy fleſh? Your poor <hi>Families</hi> call, your poor Children call, your poor <hi>Neighbours</hi> call (which all need the utmoſt you can do for them). Where are your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels to usward? for our ſakes awaken, for our ſakes ariſe and be doing; we die if you will not give us a better example, we die if you ſleep on, who ſhould awaken and ſave us. The <hi>whole Intereſt</hi> of God in the World, calls upon you; for his names ſake, for the Goſpels ſake, for the Churches ſake, for Religions ſake, which ſinks, which decays, for the ſake of all theſe, recover your Souls, and your Life.</p>
            <p>O friends, what ſhall all theſe loud cryes do upon you? ſhall all leave you ſuch lumps and loyterers?</p>
            <p>Chriſtians be yet awakened, call up all the Grace you have, whet thoſe dull and blunted Spirits, get you a better edge upon them. Why may not this word give a whet to you? If you come hither ſleepy Souls, what a Mercy would it be, if you might return home awakened? if you came hither dead, and dull, and liſtleſs Souls, what a comfort would it be, if you might return home quickned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened? what if you ſhould feel, that this word had kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled a fire in you, had made your hearts burn within you, burn with holy Love, and Life; what a mercy would this be to you! what if you might be ſent hence, with ready minds, forward minds, bent upon a more active and uſeful, and heavenly life? And what if after all this, you ſhould go away juſt as you came hither? though the Bellows have been blowing, yet your aſhes are not purged away; though the fire hath been kindled, yet it will not burn? would you like it, if all this ſhould be loſt, and do nothing upon you? if this untoward and dull temper of Soul ſhould be too hard for the Word, and you ſhould return from the Phyſician of Souls, with your diſeaſes uncured? Do what you can friends, every one of you to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48705:141"/>
help to your own recovery, to get up to this lively active frame; and if you can obtain it, then look to your hearts as long as you live, that if it be poſſible, this wretched diſtemper of a leaden, unuſeful, lifeleſs, liſtleſs, unactive heart, may never return upon you.</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Set a conſtant Watch upon it.</hi> That's a word, that is given to every Chriſtian; Mark. 13.37. <hi>What I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, Watch.</hi> And of all things we have to watch, the heart is it, that muſt chiefly be watched. Our eyes muſt be chiefly there; whether ever elſe we have to look, we muſt eſpecially <hi>look upwards, and look inwards.</hi> We muſt <hi>look upwards;</hi> our eye muſt be upon Gods eye; that all ſeeing eye that ſeeth in ſecret. Whether our eye be or no, Gods eye is ever upon our hearts. I <hi>the Lord ſearch the heart, and try the reins,</hi> Jer. 10 18. The eye of rhe Lord is a ſearching eye; there is no ſecret of the heart, but he eſpieth and ſearcheth it out; and 'tis a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous eye, that will not wink at, nor allow, nor indulge to the leaſt heart evils. The ſenſe of that jealous eye, would awe us into more watchfulneſs over our ſelves. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our neglect of ſelf inſpection is, that we forget that the Lord looks upon us. We cannot look upwards, but we ſhall behold the very eye of God upon us. If an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men ſtand looking upon us, and we do not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, we cannot tell whether they look upon us or no; but if we look ſtedfaſtly upon them, we may ſee in their very eye, that they are looking upon us. Look up to God, and you will plainly ſee that his eye is upon you. And the obſerving of Gods eye upon you, will turn your own eyes upon your ſelves. What is it that the Lord looks thus upon me for? what is it that he ſees in me? Is it any thing he likes, that he looks upon? Is it his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving eye that is upon me? Is it a look of love or of kindneſs? or is it that which he is offended at, or diſlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? Is there Jealouſie, is there Diſpleaſure, or Anger in that holy eye, that is upon me? is it a ſmiling look, or a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48705:141"/>
frowning and angry look that he caſteth upon me? Look on me, I ſee he doth, His Eye is never off me; let me look upwards when I will, I ſee that God looks down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and his Eye is directly upon me; and his Eye is a piercing Eye, it pierceth to my very entrailes, he beholds the very bottom of my heart; I had need look carefully to mine own Soul, when there is ſuch an Eye upon it Night and Day. Thus look upwards, and ſet the Lord before your ſight, as the Pſalmiſt did, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.8.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>look inwards,</hi> and ſet your hearts before your ſelves. There is an Expreſſion, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.47. <hi>If they ſhall bethink themſelves,</hi> which may be interpreted, if they ſhall return into themſelves, the Eye of the Body can't ſee it ſelf, but the eye of the Soul may, and muſt be chiefly upon its ſelf. You that are looking about, this way and that way, you had more need look homewards. There are men that are of great acquaintance in the world, but yet have no acquaintance with their own hearts. VVhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Souls be in ſafety, or among Thieves; VVhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Hearts be clean, or all beſpotted and defiled; whether they be healthful or ſickly Souls; whether they be alive or dead; 'tis more then they can tell where they be, or in what caſe they are. How is it with your Souls Friends? How fares it with you, in your inner Man? VVho is there within with you? Are there none but Friends? Is Chriſt there? Is the Spirit of Grace there? Is there a good Conſcience? or are there not Robbers within? Is not thine heart an houſeful of Thieves? Is not the world gotten in? are not the pleaſures of the Fleſh within? Is not the Devil within? that unclean Spirit, hath he not defiled and defaced the Image of God? Is he not ſowing his Tares in thee? Is not thine heart a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, diſeaſed, diſtemper'd heart? Is it not a ſlight, and frothy, and vain heart? Is it not a looſe and licentious heart? Is it not an untoward, wayward, liſtleſs heart? Look inward Chriſtians, and look often inward, and ſee what hearts you have, and how 'tis with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Commune with your own hearts.</hi> Look into them, and talk with them, and take an Account how it fares with them. If I ſhould ask you, how is it with your hearts, are they alive or dead? Are they clean Hearts, holy Hearts, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hearts, heavenly Hearts, lively and ſtrong and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upwards? Or are they hard Hearts, polluted defiled
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48705:142"/>
hearts, dull and ſlow, and liſtleſs Hearts. If I ſhould ask you thus, what account could you give? I doubt this is the account the moſt of you would give, I cannot tell. God knows how 'tis with me; for my part I know not how 'tis. That Heart hath been well look't to mean while; haſt thou carried it like a wiſe man the while? Thou haſt great acquaintance in the world; thou takeſt upon thee to know other mens hearts, and wilt judge, and cenſure them as thou liſteſt; what man? and yet haſt ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with thy ſelf? Be thou thine own judge; haſt thou been a wiſe man the while, to be ſuch a ſtranger to thy ſelf, that thou doſt not know thine own heart? Thou wilt ſay, the word tells me, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The Heart is deceitful, and who can know it?</hi> how then ſhould I know it? I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The more deceitful the Heart is, and the harder 'tis to know it, the more it had need be looked into.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though it cannot be perfectly known, yet there may be much of it known; the heart of man is a great deep, 'tis true, and though thou canſt not eaſily ſee to the bottom of it, yet if thou wilt but look down into the deep, thou muſt ſee a great way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If thou canſt not ſee thorow thine heart with thine own Eyes, yet with Gods eyes thou mayeſt. Take the help of the Eyes of the Lord, and thou mayeſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, even all that is in thine heart. God that ſees the Heart, reveals the heart; and he hath given thee ſuch diſcoveries of thy very heart in his word, he hath made the Scriptures ſuch a Looking-glaſs for thee, that if thou wouldſt look into that more, there thou mighteſt ſee thy ſelf, and all that is in thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. The word of God is <hi>a diſcerner of the thoughts, and intents of the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians, if you would ſecure your hearts from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, know them, and be acquainted more throughly with them, if you would know your hearts better, look oftner inward commune with your hearts; go down dayly into your own Boſoms, take an account of your ſelves, queſtion with your ſelves, how fares it with my Soul? is there any real ſaving Grace in me? If there be, how fares it with that Grace I have? Does it thrive, doth it flouriſh, is it kept up in Life and Activity? Doth my light ſhine, doth my Love flame, do my thoughts and my affections climb, and are they working upwards? how is
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48705:142"/>
it with my Conſcience? Is it kept pure? Doth it ſpeak peace? Doth it deal faithfully? Doth it check me, doth it ſmite me for the leaſt Evils? Doth it comfort me when 'tis better? Have I a good Conſcience? Have I the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a good Conſcience? Doth my Conſcience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me, that I have been faithful? that my Deſire, and my care, and endeavour is, and hath been in all things to approve my ſelf to the Eye of God, and to be ſincere, and upright before him!</p>
            <p>O Beloved, What a Mercy to us would it be, if we would be perſwaded to be much in ſuch heart inſpection, and much in ſuch heart communing? The Devil would find the harder work to get in; there's no Diſeaſe, or Diſtemper would then grow upon your hearts, but it would be eſpyed in the beginning; and ſo the more eaſily removed. Friends, let me prevail with you in this thing, I beſeech you in the name of the Lord, ſet more upon this Heart-ſtudy. Of all the buſineſs you have to do in the world; there's nothing more neceſſary, nothing more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous; and yet I doubt nothing more neglected. Friends if you have been ſtrangers at home, be no longer ſtrangers; never ſay again, I cannot tell how it is with my Soul, ſtudy it til you can tell; and ſtudy it diligently, and you ſhall be able to tell. The Lord will help you to underſtand your ſelves, if you will but more diligently commune with your own Hearts; will you be perſwaded to it? will you reſolve upon it, to make this a great piece of your every days work? Never look for Soul proſperity, never look for Soul ſecurity, without a ſerious and frequent diſcharge of this great Duty. You may hear all your days, and pray for a better heart as long as you live, and all in vain, if you will not Watch as well as Pray. O that the Lord would ſo ſtrike home this word upon your hearts, that you might feel this charge of the Lord, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abiding upon you, to keep your Hearts by Heart-Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and Heart-watchfulneſs.</p>
            <p>My Soul is exceedingly concern'd about the bringing you upon this Duty; and I am in great doubt, that the moſt of us are very deficient herein, either neglecting it, or but ſlightly or ſeldom being converſant in it. Sure Friends our Tongues would be better employed, our Speech would be with Grace, ſeaſoned with Salt, we ſhould have more ſavoury words coming from us, we
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48705:143"/>
ſhould commune one with another more about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of our ſouls; were there more faithful communing with our Hearts, our whole converſations would ſavour more of it. We ſhould be more Spiritual and Heavenly, more active for God, more fruitful, and abounding in every good work; our work for our Souls would be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with more Life, and with more Power; we ſhould live a more ſelf-denying, a more circumſpect, a more heedful, and a more watchful Life, were there a due watchfulneſs over our Hearts. What ſhall I ſay more in this thing? Be diligent, be careful; be diligent to know the ſtate of your hearts. If I ſhould ſay with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Prov.</hi> 27.23. <hi>Be diligent to know the ſtate of thy Flocks, and look well to thine Herds,</hi> would you not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to me? If I ſhould ſay, be diligent to look well to your Trades, and to your Money, would you not hearken to me in this? if I ſhould ſay, be diligent to take care for your Healths; and look well to your Bodies, would not this Counſel be accepted by you? How much more then ſhould you hearken to me in this. Be diligent to know the ſtate of your Souls. O Friends, be diligent to know, and be diligent to get your Souls into a good ſtate, and to ſecure them in it; be diligent to know what 'tis that hurts you, and what 'tis that hinders you, and what it is that endangers your Souls, and take heed of it; and then be diligent to know what 'tis that will help you, and further you, and advance you, and ſtabliſh your Souls in peace, and build them up in holineſs, that you may take thoſe advantages, and improve thoſe helps that are before you? Such watchfulneſs as this, what an heart reviving, what an heart flouriſhing, what an heart rejoycing would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it to your ſelves? And what abundant Praiſe, Glory and Honour would grow up to the Name of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Then ſhould thoſe Hearts of yours, which are now too much Dens of Thieves, Shops of Vanity, Fountains of folly, Neſts of Luſts, and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Merchandize become the ſacrifices of the Lord, and the Temples of the Living God, and he would dwell in them, and walk in them, and ſay of them, theſe are my reſt, here will I abide for ever.</p>

He that <hi>overcometh,</hi> there's a <hi>Soul gained,</hi> a Soul ſaved; he that is <hi>overcome, there's a Soul loſt.</hi> When Men fight for their lives, when this muſt be the iſſue, <hi>kill or be killed,</hi> how deſperately do they fight? we mannage our warfare againſt ſin and the Devil, as if there were no great matter lying upon it; Men count not themſelves any great looſers if they be overcome; and hereupon 'tis that we leave our ſelves ſo open to Temptations, and ſtand as ſo many naked men againſt our Adverſaries, and entertain ſuch Truces and Treaties with them, and make ſuch weak reſiſtance againſt them; as if our contention were about a Flea, or a dead Dog; Men do not conſider, that it is for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious life, the Devil and the World is fighting, but that's it that ſin and this world would have of you, they would
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48705:144"/>
have your hearts, they fight for your Souls.</p>
            <p>Now hereupon Chriſtians muſt be alwayes up in Armes, and ſtand to their Armes. As the Devil rallies up Armies againſt us, ſo the Lord provides us of Armour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13. to put on our Armour, and to ſtand to our Armes. <hi>Take unto you the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all to stand.</hi> We may neither ſtand unarmed, nor put on our Armour to ſleep in, put on your Armour and ſtand in your Armour; eſpecially we muſt keep cloſe about us theſe 6 pieces of Armour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Shield of Faith.</hi> v. 16. <hi>wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Devil.</hi> The Devil is ſhooting his Darts at us, and every Dart is levelled at the heart; The Devils Darts are fiery Darts, burn when they hit, that will burn up all the good in the Soul. Darts will ſtick, and fiery Darts will burn. When you ſee one Man burn in Luſt, there's a Dart of the Devil that burns in his Heart; when you ſee others flame in anger and fury, there's a fiery Dart of the Devils in his Heart; his <hi>Tongue is ſet on fire of Hell. Jam.</hi> 3.6. Think on this, you that are apt to be thus ſet on fire; the next time you are in ſuch an heat, that your hearts burn with fury, and your Tongue ſpits fire, in venting furious Language, then think with your ſelves, I feel my Soul in a flame, the fire comes out at my Mouth, Lord whence comes all this? O I had need look to my ſelf, ſure there is a fiery Dart from the Devil in mine Heart; theſe angry, hot, and haſty words are no other but the ſmoak of that Fire, which the Devil hath kindled within me. Such a Thought as this might be as water to quench that Fire. But if ſuch a thought won't do it, then take the Shield of Faith, by which you may quench theſe Fires. We are therefore exhorted 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. to reſiſt the Devil, <hi>ſtedfast in the Faith.</hi> Truſt upon Chriſt for your help, ſtand againſt the Devil, as <hi>David</hi> againſt the <hi>Philistine,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.45. <hi>thou comeſt against me with ſword and Spear,</hi> ſaies <hi>David, but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> that is, I come truſting in the Lord of Hoſts; <hi>This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand.</hi> There's his Faith, and that's his beſt Weapon. Reſiſt the Devil, and truſt in God; fight againſt ſin, and truſt in Chriſt for the victory. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord Jehovah, for in him is Everlaſting ſtrength.</hi>

Do not undo thy ſelf by thy Religion, do not ruine thy ſelf by thy Conſcience, come about after this World, ſave thy ſelf from its rage, and accept of its kindneſſes; how hard ſoever you may be thus tempted and ſet upon, and how apt ſoever thy faint heart may be, to fear and doubt, thou ſhalt never be able to ſtand; hold faſt thine helmet; hope in God, who will be thy helper and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer.

Whatever other Armour you ſeem to have, what ever faith you have, whatever hope you have, whatever word you have to ſupport you, whatever Prayer you make to help you, there's no armour will hide an hypocritical heart, from God or the Devil. God ſtrikes his dart into the falſe heart, through the joints of thine armour. And for the Devil, he is gotten in already; the Devil is already in thine heart, if it be a falſe and hypocritical heart; O get ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and uprightneſs before the Lord; ſee that there be truth in your inward parts. A ſound heart will be the beſt ſhelter, both againſt the Accuſations and Temptations of all your adverſaries; whereas if there were no enemies

            <p>Put on all this Armour, and ſtand to your Armes; be always up in Armes, be alwayes ready to receive the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.

Remember <hi>Saul</hi> and his whole Army, when they were aſleep, <hi>David</hi> came upon them, and had them at his mercy, for all their Arms; and if he had hearkned to <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> had ſmitten him dead in the place: be never ſecure, ſtand upon your Watch, or you never ſtand to your Armes. Never think you are out of danger, you are in jeopardy every hour; your Enemy the Devil, is ever walking up and down, and watcheth to devour you. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Counſel is needful, 1 Pet. 5.8. <hi>Be vigilant, be ſober, for your adverſary</hi> &amp;c. Be alwayes as the beſieged in a Town, that have their Enemy cloſe at the Gates and the Walls; they are upon their Guard night and day; eſpecially let the main fort the heart be ſtill well watched and guarded. Set fear for your Sentinel; live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fear of a ſurprize; fear will keep the Soul waking; be converſant in the World in fear; be amongſt your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal friends and acquaintance, in fear; eat and drink in fear; paſs the time of your whole warfare here in fear. O this fearleſs ſecure heart, how often hath it betray'd us into Miſchief. How often have our hearts been even choked up of the World, and ſurfeited of carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and rob'd of its peace, and ſpoil'd of its Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and we have exchanged a ſprightful, lively, chearful,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48705:146"/>
healthful Soul, for a flat, leaden, earthly, ſenſeleſs frame, before we were aware; and all becauſe we were ſecure and without fear? Live in fear daily, and in conſtant jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; be jealous of your friends, be jealous of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, be jealous of this world, be jealous of every ſin, be jealous of your ſelves. Let an holy jealouſie dwell in your eye, and let it keep you waking and watching. After all your profeſſing, and praying, and believing, and hoping, would you not looſe your hearts at laſt? and looſe all you have hoped and laboured for? then beware of Security; if you would be in ſafety, then be never ſecure; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtand, with your loins girded, and your lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Stand upon your watch Tower; keep your doors ſhut but your windows open. Let your eye obſerve the approaches, and be ready and prepared for the aſſaults, that your enemies are making daily upon you. I never look you ſhould be flouriſhing or conquering Chriſtians, till you will be perſwaded to be jealous Chriſtians, fearing and watchful Chriſtians, and therefore what I ſaid to you before, I ſay to you again and again, ſtand upon your guard and watch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Keep cloſe by your Captain and Phyſician.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Keep by the ſide of Chriſt.</hi> You know what a ſtream there once ran down from that precious ſide; a ſtream of Blood and Water; this ſtream (as to the vertue and influence of it) is running down daily; and it is for the healing of diſeaſed, and for the waſhing of ſpotted Souls. There's no balm will heal our diſeaſes, this Bloud is it, Chriſt muſt do it. There's no Sope will ſcowre off our ſpots, this water muſt cleanſe us; this Phyſick will heal every diſeaſe, this water will cleanſe us from every ſpot, and will preſent us at laſt, without ſpot or wrinkle; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. but what will diſeaſed polluted Souls do, when their Phyſician is out of the way? Many ſick perſons die of thoſe diſeaſes, which had they been near the Phyſician, might have been cured. Keep you ever near to Chriſt, his Preſence will be either preventing Phyſick, and keep off your Soul Diſeaſes, that they ſieze not upon you, or elſe 'twill be curing Phyſick, that no diſeaſe ſhall be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to you. We never wander from Chriſt, but we catch that, which we cannot eaſily claw off; if the Devil can but catch a Chriſtian wandring, what ſad work doth he make with him? we may all ſay of our wandrings, from
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48705:146"/>
Chriſt, as <hi>Naomi;</hi> Ruth 1.21. <hi>I went out full but I return empty,</hi> I went out whole but I return wounded, I went out fat and full, but I return lean and naked. What a ſad plight do we ſee looſe and wandring Souls to be in? keep you home: When <hi>Dinah, Jacobs</hi> Daughter, would be gadding abroad, what a blot got ſhe; <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.1. She went out a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and came home a <hi>Whore.</hi> Our very departings from Chriſt, are our playing the Harlots againſt him; our other lovers, to whom we turn aſide, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flour us. What harlots do many of our hearts often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? We cannot ſtay by our Lord; out we muſt be running after other lovers, and ſo we are defiled. O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your Soul Pollutions, by keeping home. Art thou gotten near to Chriſt? know when thou art well, and keep thee there. As <hi>Naomi</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ruth,</hi> Ruth 2.22. <hi>Let not the man find thee in another field.</hi> Gleaning after other Reapers, gadding after other Lovers; he will take that unkindly if he do, and thou maiſt ſmart for it. Hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> done by thee, as <hi>Boaz</hi> by <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſpread his Skirt over thee, and charged thee, keep faſt by me and by my Servants, dare not to be gadding after others? you will ſmart for it if you do, and if ever you return, it will be by weeping Croſs. Whatever wounds you receive, you will not ſay as <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.6. <hi>Theſe are the wounds which I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the houſe of my friend,</hi> but theſe wounds I have gotten in my abſence from my Friend. If I had kept me in, I had ſaved all this hurt. O prevent your miſeries, that you ſuſtain by departing from Chriſt, by keeping you by him. And if you have been wandring and catch'd any hurt, O return to your Phyſician; and when thou art made whole, then ſay to thine heart, as Chriſt to the Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Sin no more,</hi> wander no more <hi>leſt a worſe thing come unte thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians, In our firſt coming to Chriſt, and our union with him, our deadly diſeaſe is cured; we that were dead are made alive, we that were ſick are made ſound. But the ſame Jeſus that gave us this Life and Health, is he that muſt maintain our Souls in Life; and that life and ſpiritual health which we received from Chriſt by our <hi>Union,</hi> muſt be preſerved by our <hi>Communion</hi> with him. See that you be in <hi>Union</hi> with Chriſt, that you be by Faith joyned to the Lord, and then live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Communion</hi> with him; take heed of Ruptures, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48705:147"/>
breaches, take heed of diſtances, and eſtrangements from Chriſt. Have you gotten Chriſt within you? O keep him within you. Let your beloved lodge between your breaſts, and keep his dwelling in your Souls; and let there not be in you, <hi>an heart of unbelief,</hi> let there not be in you, an heart of vanity or iniquity, an heart of Pride or Guile, a Carnal, or Worldly heart <hi>to depart from the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</hi> Keep your hearts true to Chriſt, keep your hearts chaſt, keep you pure in his ſight. In your Union or Eſpouſals to Chriſt you Covenanted againſt forſaking him; Hoſ. 2.19. <hi>I will betroth you unto me for ever.</hi> So you have ſaid the ſame to him, Lord I betroth [thee] un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me for ever. Betrothing, or eſpouſing is both the <hi>neareſt</hi> Union, and the <hi>firmeſt</hi> Union.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis the <hi>neareſt</hi> Union. Our becoming Chriſtians is our Union of hearts with the Lord. Chriſt hath therein given you his heart, and you have therein given him your hearts, and your heart and his become as one heart. You that are Chriſtians are near unto Chriſt, as his own Soul; 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to Christ is one ſpirit.</hi> He loveth you, he careth for you, he tendereth you as his own Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the <hi>firmeſt</hi> union. I will betroth thee forever. It is written concerning Chriſt and his Saints, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husband and Wife; <hi>whom God hath joyned together let no man,</hi> no nor Devil neither <hi>put aſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when there is ſuch a nearneſs of Relation, and ſuch a dearneſs of Affection, there muſt be alſo <hi>Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> You muſt live together, and dwell together with Chriſt. This is not only your duty as Chriſtians, but your ſafety depends upon it.

Take heed you neither prove runaways from Chriſt, and forſake him utterly; no nor ſlink away, and skulk out, or turn aſide from him. Keep conſtant to Chriſt and keep cloſe to him.

Let no place be a place for you, let no way be a way for you, let no company be company for you, where Chriſt would not be pleaſed to find you. Let no temper or frame of Spirit grow upon you, but what Chriſt would be pleaſed to find you in. Would Chriſt be pleaſed to find you among the vain company or vile ones of the Earth? would Chriſt be pleaſed to find you in a careleſs, ſenſeleſs, untoward, jolly, frothy, or in a ſower, angry, envious, impatient temper? keep you from ſuch ways, keep you from ſuch company, keep you out of ſuch temptations, have as little to do as poſſible with them. Keep you out of vain and evil ways, company, and temptations, and keep you on with life and vigour and power, in the ways of Chriſt. Let not your ways only pleaſe Chriſt, but your walking in them; do not be ſluggs and drones and triflers in Chriſtianity; follow the Lord, and follow him fully; follow the Lord, and let your Soul follow hard after him. Be doing the Will of Chriſt, and let your hearts ſtand compleat in all the Wills of Chriſt. The moſt watchful, diligent, painful, lively Chriſtians, theſe are they, that keep neareſt to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Friends, be warned to keep you thus near to the Lord. The Lord calls you ſuch, Pſal. 148.14 <hi>A people near unto him.</hi> Approve your ſelves to be ſuch, ſince the Lord hath made you near, keep you near to him.

You complain, it may be, every one of you, that your hearts are out of order.

               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:48705:148"/>1. For the ſtrength of our hearts; it notes our liſting our ſelves under Chriſt as his Servants, and Chriſts under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the conduct of us. When we underſtand what we are engaged in, what hard ſervice we have bound our ſelves to, what a painful active life as Chriſtians, we muſt count upon; our hearts will be apt to fail us, and cry out of the life of a Chriſtian, as the Apoſtle of the work of the Miniſtry, 2 Cor. 2.16. <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> I ſhall never be able to bear through ſuch a life? but then remember your Covenant; your Baptiſmal Covenant I mean, which doth not only engage you to the Lord, but engageth the Lord to you. Look to the Captain of your Salvation, who hath bound himſelf to help you through, who hath ſaid, Heb. 13.5. <hi>I will never fail you nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you.</hi> And then you ſhall be able to ſay with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; Phil. 4.13. I <hi>can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi> Venture not on any thing in your own ſtrength, fear not nor be diſmay'd at any thing whilſt you have the Lord Jeſus to be your ſtrength. Chriſtians, be not diſheartned, fear not to engage in the ſtricteſt, and ſevereſt courſe of Chriſtianity; lean upon the Lord and he will help you through. Set your hearts to the work, and leave the care of Succeſs to him, that careth for you. Remember this, let your truſt in Chriſt, your hold on the Covenant be your ſtrength on which you lean, for the carrying you through the whole of your Chriſtian courſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Covenant will be the guide of your hearts.</hi> What is it that I have to do? how is it that I muſt live? why look into your Covenant; what is it that you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to do? how is it that you have covenanted to live? you have covenanted Holineſs and Righteouſneſs; you have covenanted againſt an idle Life, or doing nothing; againſt a trifling life, or doing your work by halfes; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a worldly, or fleſhly, or wicked life; the World, Fleſh, and Devil, theſe you have all covenanted againſt. You have covenanted the crucifying the Fleſh, and the World, the reſiſting the Devil, and to follow Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them all. You have covenanted to fight againſt the Fleſh, and the World, and to fight to the Victory; not to be leſs fleſhly than oth r men, to be leſs worldly than other men, but you have covenanted againſt a fleſhly and worldly life. Think not of carrying it fair with both; of cutting out a middle way betwixt Chriſt and the World,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48705:149"/>
betwixt a fleſhly and an heavenly life; 'tis a total victory over this fleſh, and this world, over a fleſhly, and a worldly life, which you have covenanted to purſue. When ever you are at a ſtand and are in doubt, as to any particular actions, or way of life, that you have before you; and are queſtioning whether you ſhould go on, or forbear, why then examine, would this be a ſerving my fleſh, or a ſerving the Lord? determine that well, and then your covenant would guide you, whether to do or forbear. Once let your hearts ſtand reſolved to purſue the ends of your covenant, to live ſuch an holy, ſuch an heavenly, ſuch a mortified, ſuch a ſelf-denying, ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent life, as you have covenanted to live; and then your very hearts, which are the records of your covenant, your very hearts will teach you what you ſhould do.</p>
            <p>When your fleſh at any time pleads with you, for any abatement of the ſtrictneſs of Chriſtianity; for any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of compliance with the more remiſs, and looſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians; and ſuggeſts to you, <hi>not too far, not too faſt not too high in Religion,</hi> drive on ſoftly, deal gently with thy fleſh, be not over rigid or ſevere to it; be not over buſie, do not tire thy ſelf at thy work; take time, take thine eaſe, drive on as thy carnal intereſt, and thy carnal inclinations can bear; then read over your cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and conſider. Is ſuch a life according to the write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hath been agreed upon betwixt my Lord and me? Is this cold, and indifferent, and eaſie way of Religion, all that I have covenanted for? well, this is one thing, if you would keep to your Colours, keep to your Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Take up your Croſs upon your back.</hi> This is your Lords word, Mat. 16.24. <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, let him take up his Croſs.</hi> This will be the proof of what there is of Chriſt or Chriſtianity in your hearts; a ſound heart will make a ſtrong back. He that loves much, will bear any thing; he whoſe heart is not croſs-proof is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Chriſtian. Your ſinful ſhunning the Croſs is your running from your Colours.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, ſome little Trials we have had, ſome croſſes we have met with; but for ought I know, the Lord may be preparing heavier croſſes, greater ſufferings for you, then ever you have been proved withal. O be ſo buſie a fortifying your hearts, that you may never baulk your Chriſtian courſe, whatever croſs may ſtand in the way. I
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48705:149"/>
would not that we ſhould needleſly run upon the croſs, when we may avoid it. Sufferings may come faſt enough, without our pulling them upon our ſelves. But this I would, we might every one ſtand to, reſolve in the ſtrength of the Lord, to be never the leſs hearty Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, never the leſs holy, never the leſs preciſe, never the leſs zealous in the purſuit and practiſe of a ſincere and exemplary Godly Life, for any thing you may ſuffer for it from Men or Devils. I do not barely ſay, take up your croſs rather then lay down your Chriſtianity; but take up your croſs rather than lay down your bold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity; take up your croſs rather than lay down your zeal for Chriſt, or turn aſide from the cloſeſt, and moſt reſolved following of Chriſt. Let the Croſs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make us of Chriſtians to become no Chriſtians, no nor to be leſs Chriſtians than we have ſeemed to be. It hath been ſo in former ages, that Chriſtianity hath never improved, nor thrived ſo much, as under the ſharpeſt, and ſevereſt perſecutions, and why ſhould it not be ſo ſtill? Look to your ſelves friends, there is hazard that your Souls may ſuffer, that you may be inward looſers by your over ſolicitouſneſs to eſcape outward loſſes; the Souls of many Profeſſors may be loſers, and the Souls of ſome may be quite loſt, by the fears of the croſs. Look to your ſelves, that this be none of your Caſes, that you be not looſers by perſecutions, eſpecially take heed that you be not loſt, your Souls loſt by them. Be not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted from Chriſt, be not perſecuted to Hell; let not the croſs drive you ba k under the curſe, from which you hoped that you had eſcaped.</p>
            <p>And that you may not be looſers, do what you can to be gainers, as other Chriſtians have been before you. If it grow to be winter without, get you to be warmer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; if the winds riſe, keep your garments the Cloſer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you; <hi>Think not to make your peace with evil men, by ſtriking ſail and following Chriſt more aloof;</hi> but make your Peace with God more ſure, that you may be the more able to bear the reproaches of the World. Be as the Stars, that are never ſo bright, as when the night is darkeſt. Love one another, help one another, quicken and comfort, and encourage one another, ſo much the more, for that the world hateth, and goes about to hinder you; and never
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48705:150"/>
think, after all that hath been ſaid, about the governing and guarding, the ſanctifying and keeping your hearts, that yet your hearts are right, till you can <hi>hold faſt your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,</hi> and hold on your way in all changes of weather.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Keep the Crown in your eye,</hi> and let that word be ever in your ear. Rev. 3.11. <hi>Hold faſt what thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown.</hi> Run from your Colours and you looſe the Crown. He that hath heaven in his eyes, will not fear to have holineſs in his life. The hope of the victory will encourage in the fight; the hope of the Crown will make the croſs to be eaſie, and make us faithful in the covenant. Therefore Remember that word, Rev. 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and</hi> I <hi>will give thee a Crown of life.</hi> Chriſtians, if you would not looſe the Crown, then be faithful; be faithful to the death in the covenant of your Lord. Whatever difficulties or diſcouragements you may meet with in your way, what ever hardſhips or tribulations may befal you, if you can yet ſay with the Church, Pſal. 44.17, 18. <hi>Though all this be come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſely in thy Covenant, our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way.</hi> If you can but ſay this, your Lord will ſay alſo to you, whatever I have done, or brought upon you, yet I have not forgotten thee; <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of my peace ſhall never be removed.</hi> Fight the good fight, <hi>keep the faith, till you have fini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Carry up your hearts thither, where your enemies can't come.</hi> Carry them up to heaven; whatever treaſure you lay up there, <hi>neither moth nor ruſt can corrupt, nor theives break thorow and ſteal.</hi> There's no ſafety below, the Theif will be every where upon you; whilſt you are converſant in the world, walking after the fleſh, theſe are your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies quarters; your hearts are in the midſt of them, in the midſt of thoſe Thieves, that ſeek your life, whilſt they are converſant about theſe fleſhly things. Yea, whilſt you are where God is; in your Duties, in Ordinances, if your hearts be not above at ſuch times, if you feed only on what comes down, if you aſcend not in your Duties, if you aſcend not by Ordinances, if you get not up to have Communion with God in them, this fleſh, and this world will be thruſting in upon you, and ſteal your hearts away.

Chriſt hath been riding down to you this day, as <hi>the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and horſes of fire, once were ſent down for Elijah;</hi> 2 Kin. 2.11. The Chariots came down to fetch up the Prophet in them; the Ordinances of God, that you have been at this day, was the Chariot of God, that was ſent down on purpoſe, that thoſe hearts of yours might ride up in it into Glory. I hope ſome of your hearts got up into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and are aſcended with your Lord, who came down to fetch them up. What, Chriſtian, is thine heart yet below? where was it, when the Chariot came down? what are your Souls yet among the Sheep and the Oxen? among the graſs of the Field, and the duſt of the Earth? what yet among the wormes? what yet creeping upon this Earth, and feeding upon Aſhes? do your Soules ſtill dwell in theſe Tombs and Sepulchres? I hope there may be ſome among you can ſay, I thank the Lord, mine heart is no longer here, it is riſen, it is aſcended, with my Lord, who came down for it, and hath carried it up with him. But man, how is it with thee, whoſe heart is left behind? Chriſt hath been here, and thoſe that were wiſe took the Seaſon, and got up with him into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. But is [thine] heart ſtill upon this Earth? and muſt it away again, to its old trading, to its old feeding on this dirt, and traſh? haſt thou been taſting of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Food, that hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> the bread of God that came down from heaven, and canſt thou now return to thy Quailes, or thy Husks? ſure thou hadſt not a taſte of that heavenly food, if thou doſt not yet diſguſt and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thine old carnal Delights.</p>

Let Chriſt hear that voice from you, Lord take me up with thee; here this poor wretched heart of mine lies at thy feet, I can't lift it up; 'tis too heavy for me, it hath weights but no wings; yet it groans after thee it would not that thou ſhouldſt go up without it.

            <p>Get theſe hearts to heaven, and keep them there. Get you up from Earth to Heaven, and come not down again from Heaven to Earth.

            <p>Know friends, that if there be any ſecurity in the world,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48705:151"/>
from the Robbers and the Spoilers; from your Luſts, and Temptations, from ſuffering ſuch loſſes again in your peace, the only ſecurity you have is to keep your hearts ſtill above. Haſt thou gotten thine heart to heaven? keep thee where thou art; keep you out of harmes way. If the Devil can but catch thoſe hearts again below, catch you a roving, catch you a wandring after your carnal things; if he can but meet you declining from an heavenly to an earthly Converſation, from a ſpiritual to a carnal Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, O what ſad ſpoiles of whatever good days you have had, of whatever delights, and ſatisfactions, and joyes, and comforts you have had; what ſpoiles will he make of them all? Chriſtians, when ever you can get, or do feel your hearts in a better frame, moſt full of the love, and life, and joy of the Lord, O think, what pity 'tis, what a ſad fall it will be, to make an exchange of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate, for the barren and brackiſh Pleaſures of this world? think with your ſelves, ſhall I forſake the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fig-tree, and the fulneſs of the Olive, and go and browze upon brambles?</p>
            <p>The deſign friends of all this is, to perſwade and invite you to live in conſtant Communion with God. You have been received and entertained this day, into ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and the intent and meaning of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne communion is, that by the ſweetneſs and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you find in it, you may be ſet into a way of ordinary communion with him. That your life may be a life of Communion with God; a life of faith, a life of love, a life of Holineſs and Joy, that ſo you might propheſie to your ſelves with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 23.6. <hi>Surely goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow me all the days of my life, and</hi> I <hi>ſhall dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi>

            <p>Brethren, do you in good earneſt deſire, to get you up to ſuch a life as this? do you heartily wiſh it might be thus with you? have you any hope that you ſhall obtain, and will you follow after it? will you go hence, as men and women deſigning any ſuch thing? ſhall we that have been with the Lord together this day, now agree together, in the Name of the Lord, to be reaching forward, with one heart and with one ſoul, towards ſuch an heavenly life? ſhall we help one another, and quicken one another, and ſet examples one to another, of ſuch ſpirituality and heavenlineſs? what do ye think, would be the fruit of our
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48705:152"/>
appearance before the Lord this day, might we return to our houſes, with our hearts full of ſuch holy Reſolutions, with our hearts flaming in ſuch holy deſires? Oh be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of thinking to return again to your old carnal, and ſenſual and worldly frames; to your cold, and indifferent, and lukewarm, and lifeleſs way of Religion. Let not the Devil catch you again wandring, or careleſly jogging on at your wonted rate; if he do, look for it, that whatſoever of the Divine Life or Love, of the Divine Hope or joy, hath been kindled in you this day, you will be quickly ſpoiled and robbed of it all; and thoſe poor and weakly hearts, will fall into a worſe condition then before. If you would keep any thing about you that might comfort you, if you would ſecure your Souls, from being rifled of all that you have received, if you would not return to be dark and dead and barren Souls, then remember this Counſel you have received from the Lord, to whom my Prayer is for you; which was <hi>Davids</hi> for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.18. <hi>O Lord God of Abraham, Iſaac and Iſrael our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of this people and prepare their heart unto thee.</hi> Keep theſe thoughts freſh upon your hearts, and you ſhall thereby keep your hearts, after the Lord hath ſpoken Grace unto you, from returning again to folly.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Commit the keeping of your hearts to the keeper of Iſrael.</hi> Commit them to God, Pſal. 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord keep the City, the watchmen waketh but in vain.</hi> The keeping of the heart is a greater truſt, than the keeping of a City, and therefore had need be put into ſafe hands. G d is able to keep it, 2 Tim. 1.12. I <hi>know whom I have believed, that he is able to keep, that which</hi> I <hi>have committed to him, unto that day.</hi> God is able, and God is faithful; <hi>faithful is he that hath called you, and will do it.</hi> But it may be you will ſay,</p>
            <p>O I ſhall never be able to keep mine heart in heaven; keep up the love and life and joy of God in my Soul! keep my ſelf pure, keep me cloſe to God, that the Devil never catch me wandring abroad? Why I ſee he may catch me every hour; mine heart is given to wandring, and I cannot hold it in. It would be an eaſe, and a joy, and a great delight to me, could I get to be raiſed to ſuch a pitch, to be all ſpiritual and heavenly; and there to fix, and be ever with the Lord. O what a joy it would be to me, had I but hope I might get to ſuch a pitch! but wo is me, I ſhall never be able. Why, do your duty, and for
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48705:152"/>
ſuch a comfortable ſucceſs, let that care lie on the Lord. Commit it to him, both to help you into ſuch a frame, and to keep you in it; he hath ſaid, he will not fail you, He hath ſealed to you this day, that he will help you, that he will keep you; truſt upon him and he will do it.</p>
            <p>But what is it to commit the keeping of our hearts to the Lord?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To give them to the Lord.</hi> God will keep nothing, but what is his own. Wilt thou give thine heart to the Devil, and then commit it to God to keep it for him? give your hearts to the Lord, give them to him for his Servants, and then commit them to his Cuſtody.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To truſt him with the keeping of them,</hi> Pſal. 143.9. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me O God from mine enemies, for I flee unto thee to hide me.</hi> I have many enemies, that lie in wait for my Soul, I dare not truſt to my ſelf for ſecurity. God is my truſt and my refuge; I flee unto thee to hide me; <hi>I will truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings:</hi> Pſal. 36.7.</p>
            <p>Therefore brethren, my Exhortation to you ſhall be the ſame with <hi>Peters</hi> Exhortation, to ſuffering Chriſtians; 1 Pet. 4.19. <hi>Commit the keeping of your Souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful creatour.</hi> Obſerve it, commit, but in well doing. Do not neglect your duty, and think to make it up with this, I have committed the care of my ſelf to God; I ſay, do not neglect your hearts, be not idle and careleſs of your own duty, do not leave your ſelves open to the Uſurpation of luſt or the invaſion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, do not ſuffer your hearts to lead you on in your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ways; leave not that heart of thine to be a blind houſe, a dark hole, and filthy Dungeon, full of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and then think to make up the matter, with this to ſay, I have committed it to the Lord to waſh it, and cleanſe it, and keep it; I truſt God with my Soul, he I hope will preſerve it; commit the keeping of your Souls, <hi>in well doing;</hi> do your duty, keep your hearts under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, keep them under Guard, be waſhing your hearts daily, be watching your hearts daily; though God be alſo, yet you are every one, your own keepers; do your part, to keep that which God hath committed to you and then fear not, but God will do his part, he will keep whatever you have committed to him.</p>
            <p>And thus I have at length run through this great duty of <hi>keeping the heart.</hi> The Lord knows how great need there is of every word that hath been ſpoken: O that none of it
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48705:153"/>
might be loſt. Our poor hearts, God knows, have hitherto found us but poor heart-keepers. The caſe they are in, is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſufficient to prove, how ſadly they have been look'd to. Some of them continuing in a loſt ſtate to this day, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them, but half recovered others relapſed, and fallen back from what they were once hopefully recovered to; none of our hearts, but have often been among Thieves, where we have ſuffered great loſs; and how many have been the heart diſtempers and diſeaſes we have fallen into? O what ſlight, what licentious, what liſtleſs, dull, and lazy Souls have we been? ſure theſe hearts have found us but bad keepers. O what ſhall be the ſucceſs of theſe many words that have been ſpoken? what ſay you Chriſtians? is there any hope that your hearts ſhall be better look'd to for the future? what ſay you? will you now be faithful? will you keep this charge of the Lord? keep this <hi>heart with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence?</hi> who is there among you, that will ſay, I confeſs my faults, and my great neglects this day? I confeſs I have been careleſs, the ſad frame mine heart is in, is a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; but through the Grace of God, I will look bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to my ſelf, and hope I ſhall not forget this word, as long as I live; I hope I ſhall leave medling with other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and leave cenſuring of other mens ways, and from henceforth keep mine eye more cloſe and conſtant upon mine own Soul. This do, be more faithful in keeping your ſelves, and then you may be bold, to <hi>commit your ſelves to the Lord, as unto a faithful Creator.</hi>

            <p>What hath been my deſign and deſire in this whole work? But, 1. To prepare your hearts for the Lord, that he may accept them. 2. To bring them over to the Lord, that they may become his own. 3. To keep them for the Lord, to keep them pure, that he may take pleaſure in them. O let this be done, and then you may commit them to the Lord to keep them ſafe.</p>
            <p>Will you be perſwaded, will you be prevail'd upon, thus to prepare and bring over your hearts to the Lord? thus to preſerve and keep them pure and faithful to him? and ſo truſt to his faithfulneſs? Might I prevail with you in this, I had done my work; and having put you thus into ſafe cuſtody, ſhould there be bold to leave you, in this Confidence, that you ſhould be thenceforth <hi>all kept, by the mighty power of God, through faith unto Salvation.</hi>
